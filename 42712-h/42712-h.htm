Brooklyn had been peculiarly disturbed. More
than any other of the county towns, it had
been distracted and prostrated. Farms had
been pillaged and the property of exiled Whigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
given over to Tory friends of the Governor.
Military occupation naturally resulted in great
damage to property. "Farmers were despoiled
of their cattle, horses, swine, poultry, vegetables,
and of almost every necessary article of
subsistence, except their grain, which fortunately
had been housed before the invasion.
Their houses were also plundered of every
article which the cupidity of a lawless soldiery
deemed worthy of possession, and much furniture
was wantonly destroyed. At the close of
this year's campaign, De Heister, the Hessian
general, returned to Europe with a shipload
of plundered <span class="locked">property."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> While the other
towns were receiving pay for the board of
prisoners, and thus being justified in maintaining
their crops, Brooklyn remained a garrison
town until the end.</p>

<p>After the evacuation, Brooklyn's farmers
and tradesmen at once turned their attention
to the restoration of the orderly conditions
existing before the war. It also became necessary
to reorganize the local government. In
April, 1784, was held the first town meeting
since April, 1776. Jacob Sharpe was chosen
town clerk, and Leffert Lefferts, the previous
clerk, was called upon to produce the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
records. The result of this demand has
already been described in the reference to the
missing records.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with the narrative
of Brooklyn's growth after the Revolution, it
will be necessary to return for a moment to
certain sad circumstances that followed the
battle of Brooklyn and other successes of the
British. The battle of Long Island was fought
August 27, 1776, and Fort Washington was
captured in November. These victories gave
the British between 4000 and 5000 prisoners.
At that time there were only two small jails in
New York city. One was called the Bridewell,
and was situated in Broadway near Chambers
Street, and the other was known as the
New Jail. These prisons could not accommodate
the daily increasing number of prisoners.
It was a dark hour in American history; success
seemed to perch upon the banners of the
enemy. Large accessions of prisoners were
made, and quarters had to be provided for them.
The churches were taken without ceremony
and converted into receptacles for the captives.
The sugar-houses were used for the same purpose.
One of these was situated in Liberty
Street, adjoining the old Middle Dutch Church.
That church was also used. Within its walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thousands of prisoners were placed, regardless
of comfort or sanitary rules. If its walls could
speak they would tell a tale which would make
a sad record.</p>

<p>The old North Dutch Church on the corner
of Fair Street and Horse and Cart Lane (now
Fulton and William streets) was also used as
a prison pen, and within its walls a thousand
persons were held. Within a few years this
venerable landmark has succumbed to the
march of progress.</p>

<p>The infamous Cunningham was at this time
provost marshal of the city. He possessed
the instincts of a brute, and often seemed to
own the spirit of a demon. The sick and
dying received no sympathy or care from him.
Healthy men were placed in the same room
with those having the smallpox and other
maladies. Prisoners were not allowed sufficient
food or bedding, and their clothes were
scanty. The food was not fit to give to the
beasts. The men must have reached the
verge of starvation to induce them to partake
of the unwholesome mess of wormy and mouldy
food dealt out to them. The allowance made
to the men was a loaf of bread, one quart of
peas, half a pint of rice, and one and a half
pounds of pork for six days. Large numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
died from want, privation, and exhaustion. So
crowded were these prisons that there was
no room to lie down and rest. The impure
atmosphere engendered disease. Every morning
the cry was heard, "Rebels, bring out your
dead." All who had died during the night
were carelessly thrown into the dead-cart and
carried to the trenches in the neighborhood of
Canal Street, and buried without a vestige of
ceremony.</p>

<p>But the horrors of the city prisons were
more than repeated in the tragedies of the
prison ships in the bend of the Wallabout.
The first vessels used were the freight transports
which had been employed in conveying
troops to Staten Island in 1776. These transports
were for a short time anchored in Gravesend
Bay, and received the prisoners taken on
Long Island. When New York was conquered
they were removed to the city. The
Good Hope and Scorpion for a while were
anchored off the Battery, and subsequently
were taken to Wallabout Bay, and with other
vessels were used as prisons. Two vessels
at a time were kept in this service. Among
the vessels thus used were the Whitley, Falmouth,
Prince of Wales, Scorpion, Bristol, and
Old Jersey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
In 1780 one of the vessels was burned by
the unhappy captives, who hoped thereby to
regain their liberty. The effort was unsuccessful,
and the prisoners were removed to the
Old Jersey, which continued in service until
the end of the war.</p>

<p>Wallabout Bay had the shape of a horse-shoe.
The Jersey was anchored at a point
which is now represented by the west end of
the Cob Dock. If Cumberland Street were
continued in a straight line to a point between
the Navy Yard proper and the Cob Dock, it
would pass over the spot where this vessel was
anchored.</p>

<p>Historians agree in saying that the treatment
on all these vessels was alike, and that
the Jersey was not exceptional. The Jersey
was the largest of all, and having remained in
service for so long a time had the most prisoners.
On that account she has attracted the
most attention.</p>

<p>The crew on board each ship consisted of
a captain, mates, steward, a few sailors and
marines, and about thirty soldiers. Each
prisoner on his arrival was carefully searched
for arms and valuables. His name and rank
were duly registered. He was allowed to retain
his clothing and bedding, and to use these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
but during confinement was supplied with nothing
additional. The examination having
been completed, he was conducted to the hold
of the vessel, to become the companion of a
thousand other patriots, many of whom were
covered with rags and filth, and pale and
emaciated from the constant inhalation of the
pestiferous and noxious atmosphere which impregnated
the vessel. Strong men could not
long resist inroads of sickness and disease.
Many were taken down with typhus fever, dysentery,
and smallpox. The vessel was filled
continually with the vilest malaria. The guns
were removed, portholes securely fastened,
and in their place were two tiers of lights to
admit air. Each of these air holes was about
twenty inches square, and fastened by cross-bars
to prevent escape. The steward supplied
each mess with a daily allowance of biscuit,
pork or beef, and rancid butter. The food
was of the poorest which could be obtained,
and of itself was sufficient to breed disease.
The biscuits were mouldy and worm-eaten, the
flour was sour, and the meat badly tainted. It
was cooked in a common kettle, which was
never cleaned, with impure water, and became a
slow but sure poison. The prisoners were kept
in the holds between the two decks, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lower dungeon was used for the foreigners who
had enlisted in freedom's cause. Here again
the morning salutation was, "Rebels, bring
out your dead." The command was obeyed,
and all who had found relief in death were
brought upon deck. Prisoners were allowed
to sew a blanket over the remains of their dead
companions before burial. The dead were
taken in boats to the shore, put in holes dug
in the sand, and carelessly covered. Frequently
they were washed from their resting place
by the incoming tide. Often while walking
along the old Wallabout road, between Cumberland
Street and the Navy Yard, I have seen
the remains of the gallant patriots who lost
their lives on the Jersey. In the "'fifties" of
the present century it was no uncommon thing
for pieces of bone and human skulls to be dug
up on the borders of the old road.</p>

<p>The only relief the prisoners had was permission
to remain on deck until sunset. When
the golden orb of day sunk beneath the horizon,
the ears of all were saluted with the obnoxious
cry, "Down, rebels, down." When all
had retired to the hold, the hatchway was
closed, leaving only a small trap open to admit
air. At this trapdoor a sentinel was
placed, with instructions to allow but one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to ascend at a time during the night. The
sentinels possessed the same cruel spirit as
their masters. A prisoner who had been confined
on the Jersey for fourteen months said
that, on occasions when the prisoners gathered
at the hatchway to obtain fresh air, the sentinel
repeatedly thrust his bayonet among them
and killed several. These acts created a desire
for revenge. Many of the men were
enabled to endure their trials by the thought
that the night of darkness would soon pass
away, and the day dawn when they could take
vengeance on the scoundrels who had treated
them with so much brutality.</p>

<p>An instance of this determination to be revenged
is narrated in the life of Silas Talbot.
It appears that two brothers belonging to the
same rifle corps were made prisoners and sent
on board the Jersey. The elder was attacked
with fever and became delirious. One night,
as his end was fast approaching, reason resumed
its sway, and, while lamenting his sad
fate and breathing a prayer for his mother,
he begged for a little water. His brother entreated
the guard to give him some, but the
request was brutally refused. The sick boy
drew near to death, and his last struggle came.
The brother offered the guard a guinea for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
inch of candle to enable him to behold the
last gasping smile of love and affection. This
request was refused. "Now," said he, "if it
please God that I ever regain my liberty, I'll
be a most bitter enemy." He soon after became
a free man, and, to show how well he
kept his word, it is only necessary to say that
when the war closed "he had 8 large and 127
small notches in his rifle stock." These
notches probably represented 8 officers and
127 privates.</p>

<p>On one occasion 130 men were brought to
the Jersey by the villain Sprout, who was
commissary of prisoners. As he approached
the black unsightly hulk, he pointed to her
sardonically, and told his captives, "There,
rebels, there is the cage for you."</p>

<p>The same bitter round was the daily portion
of the men,&mdash;during the day a little air and
sunlight, and being compelled to listen to the
curses and imprecations of their captors, while
at night they had to breathe the stifling air
between decks, and listen to the groans of the
sick and dying, without the power to give them
any relief.</p>

<p>Some of the men were assigned to wash
and scrub the decks. This of itself was a
great blessing, as it gave them occupation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
additional rations. During the night watches
it was as dark as Egypt between decks, for
no sort of light was allowed. Delirious men
would wander about and stumble over their
fellows. Sometimes the warning shout would
be heard, that a madman was creeping in the
darkness with a knife in his hand. At times
a soldier would wake up to find that the
brother at his side had become a corpse. The
soldiers in charge of the prisoners were mostly
Hessians, and were universally hated as mercenaries.</p>

<p>Yet no amount of cruelty could drive patriotism
from the hearts of the captives. On the
4th of July, 1782, they determined to celebrate
the anniversary in a fitting manner. On the
morning of that day, they came on deck with
thirteen national flags, fastened on brooms.
The flags were seized, torn, and trampled
under foot by the guards, who looked upon the
act as an insult. Nothing daunted, the men
determined to have their pleasure, and began
to sing national melodies. The guards became
enraged, considered themselves insulted,
and drove the prisoners below at an early
hour, at the point of the bayonet, and closed
the hatches. The prisoners again commenced
to sing. At nine o'clock in the evening an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
order was given requiring them to cease.
This order not being instantly complied with,
the animosity of the guards was aroused, and
they descended with lanterns and lances.
Terror and consternation at once reigned supreme.
The retreating prisoners were sorely
pressed by the guards, who unmercifully cut
and slashed away, wounding every one within
their reach, and inflicting in many instances
deadly blows. They then returned to the
deck, leaving the wounded to suffer, without
the means to have their wounds properly
dressed. In consequence of this explosion of
patriotism, a new torture was devised. The
men, as a punishment, were kept below on the
following day until noon, and thus were prevented
from the enjoyment of the sun and air
for six long weary hours. During this time
they were also deprived of rations and water.
As a result of the night's diabolism ten dead
bodies were brought on deck in the morning.</p>

<p>To show the heartlessness of the guards, an
incident is narrated of a man who was supposed
to be dead, and had been sewed up in his
hammock and carried on deck preparatory to
burial. He was observed to move, and the
attention of the officer in charge was called to
the fact that he was still living. "In with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him," said the officer; "if he is not dead, he
soon will be." The sailor took a knife, cut
open the hammock, and discovered that the
man was still alive. Doubtless many men who
had swooned away were buried alive.</p>

<p>At the time of these occurrences, the government
did not possess the ability to make
exchanges. The captives on the prison ships
were mostly privateersmen, and, not being in
the regular Continental service, Congress was
unwilling to restore healthy soldiers to the
ranks of the enemy, thereby adding to their
strength without a full and exact equivalent.</p>

<p>The Americans had entered into an agreement
to exchange officer for officer and soldier
for soldier. They had but few naval prisoners,
and thus could make no exchange for the unfortunate
ones on these ships. Our authorities
were compelled to let their captives on the
water go at large, for want of suitable places to
keep them. Washington took a lively interest
in the matter, and entered into a correspondence
with Henry Clinton and Admiral Digby
on the subject, threatening retaliation. He,
however, threatened and expostulated in vain.</p>

<p>The American rebels were urged by the
British officers to enter their service. Some
did enlist, with the hope uppermost in their
minds that they would be able to desert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
The prisoners were released at the close of
the war. The old Jersey was destroyed, and its
decaying timbers became buried in the mud.</p>

<p>The bones of the prison-ship martyrs lay for
many years bleaching on the banks of Wallabout
Bay, where they had been rudely buried
by the British. The action of the tide upon
the sandy banks gradually washed away the
little earth which had been thrown over them,
thereby causing the sacred relics to become
exposed to view. The attention of Congress
was frequently called to the necessity of providing
a suitable resting place for these honored
remains. The sight of these bones
strewn upon the banks of the bay was enough
to awaken the interest of the nation. At last
the citizens of Brooklyn became aroused, and
at a town meeting held in 1792, a resolution
was passed requesting John Jackson, who had
collected a large number of the bones on his
farm, which then included the land now used
by the Navy Yard, to allow the relics in his
possession and under his control to be removed
to the Reformed Dutch Church graveyard for
burial, and a monument erected over them.
General Jeremiah Johnson was the chairman
of the committee. The application was refused,
Jackson having other intentions as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
their interment. Jackson was a blunt man,
and a firm believer in the principles of Democracy
as enunciated by Jefferson. He was
one of the sachems of the Tammany Society
or Columbian Order.</p>

<p>He had several hogsheads full of bones
which he had collected upon the beach. To
consummate his plan he offered to the Tammany
Society a plot in his farm for land whereon
a suitable monument might be erected.</p>

<p>Tammany accepted the trust, and in February,
1803, entered actively upon the work.
The society at once proposed and caused to be
presented to Congress a stirring and forcible
memorial on the subject. Congress, however,
came to no determination in the matter, and
the matter remained quiescent until 1808. Between
the time of the acceptance of the offer
by Tammany and the action by Congress in
1808, Benjamin Aycrigg, a prominent and
influential citizen, became greatly interested
in the measure. In the summer of 1805,
noticing the exposed condition of these remains
on the beach of the bay, his patriotic heart was
horrified by the sight; his soul was filled with
indignation that steps had not been taken to
have them decently interred. He, in the same
year, made a contract with an Irishman living at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the Wallabout to collect all the exposed bones.
The remains thus collected formed a part of
those subsequently placed in the vault erected
on the Jackson lot by the Tammany Society.</p>

<p>In 1808 Tammany again renewed its labors.
At a meeting of the society a committee was
appointed, called the Wallabout Committee,
consisting of Jacob Vandervoort, John Jackson,
Burdett Stryker, Issachar Cozzens, Robert
Townsend, Jr., Benjamin Watson, and Samuel
Coudrey. This committee was deeply interested
in the work, and used every available
means to enlist public sympathy and assistance.
Memorials were prepared and circulated,
and appeals made through the press and
otherwise, urging the citizens to come forward
and aid the sacred cause. In their efforts they
did not confine themselves to New York, but
sought to create a national interest in the
undertaking. The patriotism of the people
was appealed to, and the effort was crowned
with success. When the subject was thus
forcibly presented, the citizens of the young
republic realized their obligation to provide a
proper burial place for the dust and bones
of her brave sons, through whose death the
nation rose into existence. The measure was
presented in a way which could not be resisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The inhabitants of all sections became greatly
interested, and nobly responded to the call,
and the committee, finding so many ready to
aid, assist, and approve, were enabled to commence
the erection of the structure much
sooner than they had at first anticipated.</p>

<p>The spot given was situated in Jackson
Street (now Hudson Avenue), near York Street,
abutting the Navy Yard wall. The street was
named after the owner of the land. The name
was afterward changed to Hudson Avenue.</p>

<p>The land was formally deeded by Jackson
to the Tammany Society in 1803. When
all things were ready the society caused the
remains collected by Jackson, with all the
bones found upon the beach, to be committed
to the tomb with appropriate ceremonies.</p>

<p>The arrangements for laying the corner-stone
were completed, and the 13th of April,
1808, fixed for that interesting ceremony. The
order of exercises was as follows: At eleven
o'clock the procession formed at the ferry, foot
of Main Street, marched through that street
to Sands Street, thence to Bridge Street, along
Bridge to York Street, through York Street
to Jackson, and thence to the ground.</p>

<p>As Major Aycrigg had ever manifested unabated
interest in this labor of love, he was
properly selected as grand marshal of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The first division of the procession consisted
of a company of United States marines, under
command of Lieutenant-Commandant Johnson.
The second division was composed of
citizens of New York and Brooklyn. The
third division embraced the committees of the
various civic societies. The fourth division
contained the Grand Sachem of the Tammany
Society, Father of the Council, and orator of
the day. The fifth division carried the corner-stone
with the following <span class="locked">inscription:&mdash;</span></p>

The sixth division was composed of a detachment
of artillery under command of Lieutenant
Townsend.</p>

<p>The procession having reached the ground,
the artillery were stationed upon a neighboring
hill, and the various divisions took the
positions assigned them.</p>

<p>The oration, which was a brilliant effort,
was delivered by Joseph D. Foy. The stone
was then lowered to its place and duly laid by
Benjamin Romaine, Grand Sachem of the
Tammany Society, assisted by the committee,
after which a grand salute was fired, and the
band discoursed sweet and solemn notes.</p>

<p>The vault was completed in May, 1808.
Arrangements were made for an imposing display,
and no pains were spared in preparation.
The various societies and public bodies were
ready and anxious to do all in their power to
render the occasion impressive and memorable.
The citizens turned out <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> on the
26th of May, 1808, to bear testimony to the
worth of these brave men whose obsequies
were to be celebrated. They assembled at
ten o'clock in the park in front of the City
Hall, New York, under command of Brigadier
Generals Morton and Steddiford, Garret Sickels,
Grand Marshal, assisted by twelve aides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

<p>The orator of the day was Dr. Benjamin
DeWitt, who delivered an able and patriotic
address to the assembled multitude. He feelingly
depicted the sufferings endured in British
dungeons, and drew tears to many eyes by
his eloquent and touching remarks, referring
to the tyranny of the oppressors and the patience
of the patriots. The oration concluded,
in painful silence the coffins were committed
to their resting place. Rev. Mr. Williston
then pronounced the benediction, "To the
King, Immortal, Invisible, the All-wise God, be
glory everlasting, amen." The occasion was
one long remembered in both cities.</p>

<p>During many years these relics remained
forgotten in their sepulchre. The grade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Jackson Street was altered so as to take a part
of the sacred ground. Jackson, when he gave
the land, was not far-sighted enough to have
secured the passage of an act to preserve its
precincts intact, free from invasion by streets,
and exempt from taxation. The land at one
time was sold for taxes. It seemed as if the
past had been forgotten. Then it was that
Benjamin Romaine came forward and purchased
the lot. In order to preserve it from
desecration, he adopted it as his family burial
plot. He resolved to be buried there himself,
and placed within the vault a coffin designed
for his mortal remains. He constructed the
ante-chamber over the tomb. Upon the property
he placed the following <span class="locked">inscription:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>First&mdash;The portal to the tomb of 11,500
patriot prisoners of war who died in dungeons
and pestilential prison ships in and about the
City of New York during the war of our Revolution.
The top is capped with two large urns
in black, and a white globe in the centre.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;The interior of the tomb contains
thirteen coffins assigned in the order as observed
in the Declaration of Independence,
and inserted thus&mdash;New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Third&mdash;Thirteen beautifully turned posts,
painted white, and capped with a small urn in
black, and between the posts the above-named
States are fully lettered.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;In 1778, the Colonial Congress
promulgated the Federal League compact,
though it was not finally ratified until 1781,
only two years before the peace of 1783.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;In 1789, our General National Convention,
to form a more perfect unison, did
ordain the present Constitution of the United
States of America, to be one entire Sovereignty,
and in strict adhesion to the equally
necessary State rights. Such a republic must
endure forever.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1842, a large number of citizens applied
to the Legislature for permission to remove the
remains to a more private place. Romaine
vigorously and eloquently objected to the proposed
change, and the matter was permitted
to rest quietly until after his death in 1844.
During the following year attention was again
called to the forlorn and neglected condition
of the sepulchre. Henry C. Murphy was then
in Congress, representing Kings and Richmond
counties. The abject condition of the
vault was brought to the notice of Congress,
and action taken. The military committee
recommended an appropriation of $20,000 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
secure a permanent tomb and monument.
The report was drawn by Henry C. Murphy,
whose exertions in this behalf were untiring.
The effort, however, was not successful.</p>

<p>Samuel Boughton, John T. Hildreth, John
H. Baker, and other public-spirited men, holding
diverse political views, started subscription
papers, and published articles in the papers
urging the importance of immediate action to
accomplish the praiseworthy object.</p>

<p>In 1855, a meeting was held and a Martyrs'
Monument Association formed. This association
intended to have representatives from
each State and Territory. The committee
started with commendable energy. They early
took the ground that Fort Greene was the
proper site. Plans were proposed and subscriptions
solicited. For a long time nothing
more was done. The Common Council agreed
to permit the use of Fort Greene. It was not
until June, 1873, that the remains of the prison-ship
martyrs were carried to the vault on the
face of Fort <span class="locked">Greene.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The narrative here concluded has passed far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
beyond the limits of the period to which this
chapter is devoted. Turning to the post-Revolutionary
period, we find the county towns
resuming a normal course of life. The Dutchmen
who gathered at the Brooklyn church
ceased to talk of war. The Episcopalians, who
worshiped in John Middagh's barn, at the corner
of Henry and Poplar streets, turned from
politics to denominational questions, and the
"Independents" built a meeting-house on the
Fulton Street ground afterwards taken by St.
Anne's Buildings.</p>

<p>We learn from the "Corporation Manual"
(1869) that the first step toward a fire department
within the limits of the present city was
taken in April, 1785, by the organization of a
fire-company. At a meeting of the freeholders
of the town, held at the house of Widow
Moser, in Fulton Street, near the ferry, it was
agreed that the company should be composed
of seven members, who should be commissioned
as firemen for one year. They selected
the following persons as the members of the
company: Henry Stanton, captain; Abraham
Stoothoof, John Doughty, Jr., Thomas Havens,
J. Van Cott, and Martin Woodward. They
also voted to raise by tax the sum of £150 for
the purchase of a fire-engine. Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
regulations agreed upon for the government
of the new company was a requirement that
the members should meet on the first Saturday
of each month, to play, clean, and work
their engine, and that in case of their non-attendance,
upon notification from their captain,
a fine of eight shillings should be imposed
upon them, and that upon the captain, in the
event of his neglecting properly to notify the
members, a fine of sixteen shillings should be
imposed. The engine was in due time procured.
It was constructed by Jacob Boome,
of New York city, who had just then commenced
business as the first engine-builder
ever located in that city. Previous to his time,
the fire-engines had generally been imported
from England. The company adopted the
name of "Washington Engine Company No.
1," and was, up to the time of dissolution
of the Volunteer Department, still in active
existence. Their engine-house was situated
in a lane, now called Front Street, near its
junction with Fulton Street.</p>

<p>The firemen continued to be chosen annually
in town meeting, and the appointment
was much sought after as conferring respectability
of position in the community. On the
30th of April, 1787, the number of firemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was increased to eleven, and it was resolved
that each fireman should take out a license,
for which he should pay a fee of four shillings,
the sums thus accruing being appropriated to
the ordinary expenses of the company.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March, 1788, came the
first state legislation relative to the firemen
of Brooklyn. In 1794 there were about fifty
families residing within the limits of the fire
district; the entire population, including some
100 slaves, numbering 350 souls. There were
about seventy-five buildings in the district,
mainly located between what is now called
Henry Street and the ferry. Those devoted
to business purposes were generally near the
ferry, where a supply of water from the river
could readily and easily be obtained. Although
fires were of exceedingly rare occurrence,
and trivial in their character, yet nine
years of use, or rather disuse and decay and
rust, had rendered the engine unserviceable.
In view of this fact, on the first Tuesday of
April, 1794, it was resolved in town meeting
that a subscription should be authorized to
raise the funds necessary for the purchase of
a new engine. The sum of £188 19s. was
speedily collected, and a new and more powerful
engine was procured. In 1795 the Legislature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
extended the limits of the fire district,
and increased the volunteer force to thirty
men. In town meeting it was resolved that
each house should be provided with two fire-buckets,
under a penalty of two shillings for
every neglect so to provide after due notification.
In 1796 a fire-bell was purchased by
popular subscription, and set up in the storehouse
of Jacob Remsen, at Fulton and Front
streets, in sight of the ferry.</p>

<p>In the awarding of the ferry lease in 1789,
it was ordered "that the boats, together with
their masts and sails, be of such form and dimensions
as the wardens of the port of New
York should approve; that each boat be constantly
worked and managed by two sober,
discreet, and able-bodied experienced watermen;
that each boat be always furnished with
four good oars and two <span class="locked">boat-hooks."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> A new
ferry at Catherine Street was established in
1795.</p>

<p>Although the ferry was in active operation,
traveling by land was by exceedingly primitive
stages. As late as 1793, according to
Furman, there was no post-office on any part
of Long Island, and no mail carried on it. It
was not until about the opening of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
century that the first post-route was started.
As late as 1835 "the regular mail stage left
Brooklyn once a week, on Thursday, having
arrived from Easthampton and Sag Harbor
the afternoon of the previous day; and this
was the only conveyance travelers could then
have through this Island, unless they took a
private carriage." The practice was to leave
Brooklyn about nine in the morning, to dine
at Hempstead, and then "jog on to Babylon,
where they put up for the <span class="locked">night."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>By the enterprise of the Flushing Bridge
and Road Company, incorporated in 1802,
the distance between Flushing and Brooklyn
was shortened about four miles. Three years
later the Wallabout and Brooklyn Toll Bridge
Company laid out a road extending from the
Cripplebush road to the easterly side of the
Wallabout mill pond, over which a bridge
connected with Sands Street.</p>

<p>Within the limits of the <span class="locked">town<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> the spirit
of real estate enterprise appeared in various
quarters, but perhaps the most ambitious undertaking
was that of the holders of the Sands
and Jackson tract, surveyed in 1787, and lying
on the East River between the Wallabout and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the Brooklyn ferry. To the prospective village
planned for this region was given the
name of Olympia, after the habit of bestowing
classical names which began to appear in post-Revolutionary
days. In 1801 John Jackson
sold forty acres of Wallabout lands to the
United States for $40,000.</p>

<p>The columns of the "Long Island Weekly
Intelligencer," published by Roberson &amp; Little,
booksellers and stationers, at the corner of
Old Ferry and Front streets, give interesting
glimpses of this period. In 1806 Henry Hewlet
dealt in "general merchandise" near the
Old Ferry; John Cole was coach-maker; Dr.
Lowe's office was "at the Rev. Mr. Lowe's,
corner of Red Hook Road." There was demand
for five apprentices at Amos Cheney's
shipyard. Benjamin Hilton sold china, glass,
and earthenware, "at New York prices," in
Old Ferry Street. Postmaster Bunce had
fifty-three letters that had not been called for.</p>

<p>In a later issue of the "Intelligencer" the
editor remarks that he has been "requested
to suggest the propriety of each family placing
lights in front of their houses, not having
the advantage of lamps, as great inconvenience
and loss of time arises from the neglect,
particularly on dark nights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
In 1808 the town appropriated $1500 for
the erection of a new "poor house." The
county court house of this period was at Flatbush,
then the county seat. The old court
house had been burned in 1758. The money
required to build the new court house was
raised by an assessment upon the inhabitants
of the county. This building continued in
use thirty-four years, when, by reason of its
dilapidated condition, a new court house and
jail were built in 1792. The court house cost
$2944.71. The contractor was Thomas Fardon,
and the plans for the building were furnished
by Messrs. Stanton, Newton, and James
Robertson. In referring to the court house,
Furman says that "in 1800 the court house
was let to James Simson for one year at £3
in money." In this agreement "the justices
reserved for themselves the chamber in the
said house called the court chamber, at the
time of their publique sessions, courts of common
pleas, and private meetings; as also the
room called the prison, for the use of the
sheriff if he had occasion for it." The building
stood for forty years, when it was destroyed
by fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hamlet of Brooklyn took
on many of the characteristics of a maturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
village. Joseph B. Pierson removed from New
York to Brooklyn in 1809, and opened a circulating
library on Main Street, two doors from
Sands Street. In the "Long Island Star" of
June, 1809, George Hamilton advertised a
select school where "students were taught to
make their own pens." Hamilton was succeeded
by John Gibbons, who in September
announced the opening of an academy for
both sexes, where the various educational
branches are "taught on unerring principles."
Mrs. Gibbons was to "instruct little girls in
Spelling, Reading, Sewing, and Marking."
To the notice of an evening school for young
men is appended: "N.&nbsp;B. Good pronunciation."</p>

<p>Two years later there was a private school
opposite the post office; John Mabon taught
the Brooklyn Select Academy; and at the
inn of Benjamin Smith, on Christmas-eve, an
exhibition was given by the pupils of Platt
Kennedy. At this time the town had a floor-cloth
factory, eight or ten looms were at work
in Crichton's cotton goods manufactory, and
over one hundred people worked in rope-walks.
Abraham Remsen kept the one dry
goods store at Fulton and Front streets.</p>

<p>Over the Black Horse tavern lived for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
time the "Rain-water Doctor," who was consulted
by people coming great distances.
This strange man dealt mostly in herbs and
simples, but his specialty was rain water,
which he praised as containing power to cure
all manner of ills. He often signed himself,
"Sylvan, Enemy of Human Diseases." Sylvan
was evidently the first of a long list of
"rain-water" quacks, against whom the regular
practitioners of this and later periods had
occasion to <span class="locked">contend.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
At the time when the census of Long Island
(in 1811) estimated the population of Brooklyn
at 4402, rapid progress had also been made by
other towns in the county. Flatlands, which
does not seem to have been particularly disturbed
by the British occupation,&mdash;the church
and schools continuing their regular sessions
throughout the period,&mdash;built a new church
in 1794, which was painted red and sanded,
and had Lombardy poplars in front and rear.
Church-going was a cold experience in those
days, the new church, like its predecessors,
being without means of heating, save the foot-stoves
carried by women. It was not until
1825 that a large wood-stove was introduced.
The schoolhouse stood within the original
lines of the graveyard.</p>

<p>Gravesend, which had passed through an
active early period, had in 1810 a population
of 520. The hamlet was conservative in its
habits of life and slow in numerical growth.
To reach Coney Island from Gravesend at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
this time, it was necessary to ford the creek
at low tide. The Coney Island Bridge and
Road Company was organized in 1823. To
get their letters the Gravesend people were
obliged to go to <span class="locked">Flatbush.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The old schoolhouse,
after being in service for sixty years,
was in 1788 succeeded by a larger building,
which was in service for half a century. The
Reformed Church records were still kept in the
Dutch language. The church was a long low
building with a gallery, under which, on the
west side, were the negro quarters.</p>

<p>Flatbush had had a taste of the Revolutionary
fighting, and suffered considerably during
the British <span class="locked">occupation.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The mill finished in 1804, on John C. Vanderveer's
farm, is described as the first mill on
the island. The mills became a prominent
feature of Flatbush scenery. Clustered near
them were some of the quaintest examples of
Dutch and colonial architecture that were to
be found in this country. The examples surviving
to-day give a distinctive charm to this
village. In due time the stocks which had
stood in front of the court house, the near-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="locked">whipping-post,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and the public brew-house all
disappeared.</p>

<p>On the 2d of July, 1791, public notice was
given of the plan for building a county court
house and jail at Flatbush. The notice stated
that the conditions would be made known
by application to Charles Doughty, Brooklyn
Ferry, and that propositions in writing would
be received until July 15 by him and Johannes
E. Lott, of Flatbush, and Rutgert Van Brunt
of Gravesend.</p>

<p>Cruger, while mayor of New York city, had
his residence within the village. Generals
Howe, Clinton, and other leading Tories had
their headquarters within its limits subsequent
to the battle of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Erasmus Hall, at Flatbush, was erected in
1786, its charter bearing the same date as that
of the Easthampton Academy. The first
public exhibition of Erasmus Hall was held
September 27, 1787, "and the scene," says
Stiles, "was graced by the presence of the
Governor of the State, several members of
the Assembly, and a large concourse of prominent
gentlemen of the vicinity." The subject
of public instruction continued to be agitated
in the public prints and the pulpit, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
attention of the Legislature was repeatedly
called by the Governor's messages to the paramount
need of having a regular school system
throughout the State. Finally, in 1795, that
body passed "an act for the encouragement
of schools," and made an appropriation of
$50,000 per annum for five years "for the purpose
of encouraging and maintaining schools
in the several cities and towns in this State in
which children of the inhabitants residing in
the State shall be instructed in the English
language or be taught English grammar, arithmetic,
mathematics, and such other branches
of knowledge as are most useful and necessary
to complete a good English education."</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. John H. Livingston, who,
with Senator John Vanderbilt, brought about,
the establishment of the academy, was succeeded
as principal by Dr. Wilson, who also
held a professorship at Columbia College.
The records of the academy reveal an interesting
list of names, and the institution has
held an important relation to the educational
interests of Flatbush.</p>

<p>New Utrecht, where the first resistance to
the British forces had been offered, and whose
church had been used as a hospital and also
as a riding-school by the British officers, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
quick to assume its wonted ways after the
departure of the troops when peace with England
had been declared. During the period
between 1787 and 1818 the Rev. Petrus
Lowe was the <span class="locked">pastor.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The progress of Bushwick after the Revolution
was noteworthy. The old Dutch church
had been built early in the last century. The
dominies from Brooklyn and Flatbush had
previously ministered to the people when occasion
called. The old octagonal church received
a new roof in 1790, a front gallery five years
later, and so it remained until 1840. <span class="locked">Stiles<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
mentions Messrs. Freeman and Antonides as
the earliest pastors, and Peter Lowe as serving
here until 1808. A regiment of Hessians had
their winter quarters here in 1776, barracks
being put up on the land of Abraham Luqueer,
and free use being made of wood from the Wallabout
swamp. The case of Hendrick Suydam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was typical. Suydam had to give quarters in
his <span class="locked">house,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and the filthy habits of these unsavory
mercenaries were shockingly characteristic
of this unhappy period. Stiles mentions,
among the "patriots of Bushwick," John Provost,
John A. Meserole, John I. Meserole,
Jacob Van Cott, David Miller, William Conselyea,
Nicholas Wyckoff, and Alexander
Whaley, but no such list gives due honor
to the service of all the Bushwick patriots.</p>

<p>After the Revolution Bushwick had "three
distinct settlements or centres of population."
These were "Het Dorp," the original town
plot at the junction of North Second Street
and Bushwick Avenue; "Het Kivis Padt,"
on the cross-roads at the junction of Bushwick
Avenue and the Flushing Road; and "Het
Strand," along the East River shore. The
first mentioned was the centre of village activity,
with the old church for chief landmark.</p>

<p>Of the town house with its tall liberty pole,
<span class="locked">Field<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> writes: "Long after the Revolution
the old town house continued to be the high
seat of justice, and to resound with the republican
roar of vociferous electors on town meeting
days. The first Tuesday in April and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fourth of July, in each succeeding year, found
Het Dorp suddenly metamorphosed from a
sleepy Dutch hamlet into a brawling, swaggering
country town, with very debauched habits.
Our Dutch youth had a most enthusiastic tendency,
and ready facility in adopting the convivial
customs and uproarious festivity of the
loud-voiced and arrogant Anglo-American
<span class="locked">youngers.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> One day the close-fisted electors
of Bushwick devised a plan for easing the
public burdens by making the town house
pay part of the annual taxes, and accordingly
it was rented to a Dutch publican, who afforded
shelter to the justices and constables, and by
his potent liquors contributed to furnish them
with employment.</p>

<p>"In this mild partnership, so quietly aiding
to fill each others' pockets, our old friend Chas.
Zimmerman had a share, until he was ousted,
because he was a better customer than landlord.
The services of the church were conducted
in the Dutch language until about the
year 1830. The clergyman had the care of
five churches, each of which received his spiritual
services in turn. The homely but pious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
men who performed these duties were sometimes
learned and dignified gentlemen, always
a little aristocratic in their ways, for the dominie
of a Dutch colony was an important functionary,
whom the Governor-General himself could
not snub with impunity. One of their self-indulgent
customs would strike a modern
community with horror. On arriving at the
church, just before the time for Sunday service,
the good dominie was wont to refresh
himself from the fatigue of his long ride with
a glass of some of the potent liquors of the
time at the bar of the town house.</p>

<p>"At last the electors of Bushwick got tired
of keeping a hotel, and unanimously quit-claimed
their title to the church. Some
time after the venerable structure [the town
house] was sold to an infidel Yankee, at
whose bar the good dominie could no longer
feel free to take an inspiriting cup before
entering the pulpit, and the glory of the town
house of Bushwick departed."</p>

  <div class="caption">FERRY PASSAGE CERTIFICATE, 1816
</div></div>

<p>The graveyard of the original Dutch settlement
lay in sight of the church, and the last
remains within its borders were not disturbed
until 1879, when the bones were removed in
boxes and placed under the Bushwick Church.
Not far distant were the De Voe, De Bevoise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and Wyckoff houses, the last named built by
Theodorus Polhemus, of <span class="locked">Flatbush.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>On the river front was the famous tavern of
"Charlum" Titus. Toward Bushwick Creek
was the Wartman homestead. On Division
Avenue was the Boerum house; the Remsen
house was on Clymer Street. Peter Miller,
Frederic De Voe, and William Van Cott were
prominent residents.</p>

<p>On Newtown Creek stood Luqueer's mill,
built in 1664, by Abraham Jansen, and the
second to be erected within the limits of the
present city of Brooklyn. Freekes' mill at
Gowanus was the oldest, a pond being formed
by damming the head of Gowanus Kill. Remsen's
mill was at the Wallabout. It was built
in 1710, and it was from the vantage ground
of his residence here that Rem Remsen witnessed
so many of the prison-ship horrors.
Remsen performed many humane acts toward
the unfortunates of the floating dungeons.</p>

<p>The boundary dispute between Newtown
and Bushwick&mdash;a wrangle beginning in Stuyvesant's
day and lasting until 1769&mdash;forms one
of the most picturesque features of political life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in the history of the two towns. "Arbitration
Rock," as a famous landmark in the survey
was called, having been destroyed, a new rock
was placed in position by Nicholas Wyckoff,
with the permission of the Commissioners appointed
to resurvey the line in 1880, and still
remains.</p>

<p>We have seen that one section of the town
of Bushwick, or rather an outlying group of
farms and houses, lay on the river front.
Traffic to and from New York naturally
passed through this river section of the settlement.
At the beginning of the century
Richard M. Woodhull, a New York merchant,
established a horse-ferry from Corlaer's Hook,
close to the foot of the present Grand Street,
New York, to the foot of the Long Island
road, now bearing the name of North Second
Street.</p>

<p>The New York landing-place of the ferry
was then considerably above the settled part
of the town. In New York at this period the
tendency of development still was along the
eastern side of the island. "The seat of the
foreign trade," says Mr. Janvier, "was the East
River front; of the wholesale domestic trade,
in Pearl and Broad streets, and about Hanover
Square; of the retail trade, in William, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Fulton and Wall. Nassau Street and
upper Pearl Street were places of fashionable
residence; as were also lower Broadway and
the Battery. Upper Broadway, paved as far as
Warren Street, no longer was looked upon as
remote and inaccessible; and people with exceptionally
long heads were beginning, even,
to talk of it as a street with a future; being
thereto moved, no doubt, by consideration of
its magnificent appearance as the great central
thoroughfare of the city upon Mangin's prophetic
map."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the development of New
York on the East River side, there were two
miles of travel between Woodhull's ferry and
the business part of the city. Woodhull
bought and "boomed" property in the vicinity
of the ferry road on the Long Island side,
then known as Bushwick Street, and to the
settlement in this region he gave the name of
Williamsburgh, "in compliment to his friend,
Colonel Williams, U.&nbsp;S. engineer, by whom it
was surveyed." A ferry-house, a tavern, a hay-press,
appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>"An auction was held," writes John M.
<span class="locked">Stearns,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> "at which a few building lots were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
disposed of. But the amount realized came
far short of restoring to Woodhull the money
he had thus prematurely invested. His project
was fully a quarter of a century too soon.
It required half a million of people in the city
of New York, before settlers could be induced
to move across the East River away from the
attractions of a commercial city. Woodhull
found that notes matured long before he could
realize from the property; and barely six years
had passed before he was a bankrupt, and the
site of his new city became subject to sale by
the sheriff. By divers shifts the calamity was
deferred until September 11, 1811, when the
right, title, and interest of Richard M. Woodhull
in the original purchase, and in five acres
of the Francis J. Titus estate, purchased by
him in 1805, near Fifth Street, was sold by
the sheriff in favor of one Roosevelt. James
H. Maxwell, the son-in-law of Woodhull, became
the purchaser of Williamsburgh; but
not having the means to continue his title
thereto, it again passed under the sheriff's
hammer, although a sufficient number of lots
had by this time been sold to prevent its re-appropriation
to farm and garden purposes."</p>

<p>Then came Thomas Morrell, of Newtown,
who bought the Titus homestead farm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
twenty-eight acres, prepared a map, and set
down Grand Street as a dividing line. In
1812, Morrell obtained from New York city a
grant for a ferry from Grand Street, Bushwick,
to Grand Street, New York.</p>

<p>This new town site, extending between
North Second Street as far over as the present
South First Street, received the name of Yorkton.
The rivalry between the Morrell and the
Woodhull ferry became very heated. "While
Morrell succeeded as to the ferry," writes Mr.
Stearns, "Woodhull managed to preserve the
name Williamsburgh; which applied at first
to the thirteen acres originally purchased, and
had extended itself to adjoining lands so as to
embrace about thirty acres, as seen in Poppleton's
map in 1814, and another in 1815, of
property of J. Homer Maxwell. But the first
ferry had landed at Williamsburgh, and the
turnpike went through Williamsburgh out into
the island. Hence, both the country people
and the people coming from the city, when
coming to the ferry, spoke of coming to Williamsburgh.
Thus Yorkton was soon unknown
save on Loss's map, and in the transactions
of certain land-jobbers. Similarly the
designations of old farm locations, being obsolete
to the idea of a city or a village, grew into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
disuse; and the whole territory between Wallabout
Bay and Bushwick Creek became
known as Williamsburgh."</p>

<p>At this time the owners of shore property
refused to have a road opened through their
property or along the shore. The two ferries
were not connected by shore road, nor with
the Wallabout region, and neither ferry prospered
during the lifetime of either Woodhull
or Morrell. General Johnson, in going from
his Wallabout farm to Williamsburgh, "had
to open and shut no less than seventeen barred
gates within a distance of a mile and a half
along the shore." The owners opposed Johnson's
movement for a road, but with the aid of
the Legislature the road was opened, business
at the ferries immediately improved, and Williamsburgh
began to grow. A Methodist congregation
built a church in 1808; a hotel appeared
at about the same time, and in 1814
there were 759 persons in the town. Noah
Waterbury, by the building of a distillery at
the foot of North Second Street and other
enterprises, earned the title of "The Father of
Williamsburgh."</p>

<p>As the hamlet of Brooklyn waxed in size
and took on the characteristics of an organized
community, with a formulated political
plan, a fire department, a commercial nucleus
that justified a <span class="locked">petition<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> to the Legislature for
the establishment of a local bank, and a population
of nearly 5000 people, it began to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
more directly and inevitably than it ever had
theretofore the effect of political and commercial
movements in the State, and in the nation
as a whole.</p>

<p>The early years of the present century, during
which Napoleon was terrorizing Europe,
were years of formative uncertainties to the
young United States. John Fiske has called
this time "the critical period" of American history.
Speaking of the extraordinary commercial
manifestations of the post-Revolutionary
period, Mr. Fiske says: "Meanwhile, the different
States, with their different tariff and
tonnage acts, began to make commercial war
upon one another. No sooner had the other
three New England States virtually closed
their ports to British shipping than Connecticut
threw hers wide open, an act which she
followed up by laying duties upon imports
from Massachusetts. Pennsylvania discriminated
against Delaware, and New Jersey, pillaged
at once by both her greater neighbors,
was compared to a cask tapped at both ends.</p>

<p>"The conduct of New York became especially
selfish and blameworthy. That rapid
growth, which was so soon to carry the city and
the State to a position of primacy in the Union,
had already begun. After the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the British the revival of business went on
with leaps and bounds. The feeling of local
patriotism waxed strong, and in no one was it
more completely manifested than in George
Clinton, the Revolutionary general, whom the
people elected Governor for nine successive
terms. From a humble origin, by dint of
shrewdness and untiring push, Clinton had
come to be for the moment the most powerful
man in the State of New York. He had
come to look upon the State almost as if it
were his own private manor, and his life was
devoted to furthering its interests as he understood
them. It was his first article of faith
that New York must be the greatest State in
the Union. But his conceptions of statesmanship
were extremely narrow. In his mind, the
welfare of New York meant the pulling down
and thrusting aside of all her neighbors and
rivals. He was the vigorous and steadfast
advocate of every illiberal and exclusive measure,
and the most uncompromising enemy to
a closer union of the States. His great popular
strength and the commercial importance
of the community in which he held sway made
him at this time the most dangerous man in
America."</p>

<p>The relations of the States became more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
amicable in the early years of the century, the
rival commonwealths being drawn together by
a general obligation of self-defense as against
England. In 1808 had come Jefferson's Embargo
Act, of whose influence in New York
John Lambert writes: "Everything wore a
dismal aspect at New York. The embargo
had now continued upwards of three months,
and the salutary check which Congress imagined
it would have upon the conduct of the
belligerent powers was extremely doubtful,
while the ruination of the commerce of the
United States appeared certain if such destructive
measures were persisted in. Already had
120 failures taken place among the merchants
and traders, to the amount of more than
5,000,000 dollars; and there were above 500
vessels in the harbor which were lying up useless,
and rotting for want of employment.
Thousands of sailors were either destitute of
bread, wandering about the country, or had
entered the British service. The merchants
had shut up their counting-houses and discharged
their clerks; and the farmers refrained
from cultivating their land; for if they brought
their produce to market they could not sell it
at all, or were obliged to dispose of it for only
a fourth of its value."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Elsewhere in his journal, Lambert writes:
"The amount of tonnage belonging to the
port of New York in 1806 was 183,671 tons,
and the number of vessels in the harbor on
the 25th of December, 1807, when the embargo
took place, was 537. The moneys collected
in New York for the national treasury, on
the imports and tonnage, have for several
years amounted to one fourth of the public
revenue. In 1806 the sum collected was
6,500,000 dollars, which, after deducting the
drawbacks, left a net revenue of 4,500,000
dollars, which was paid into the treasury of
the United States as the proceeds of one year.
In the year 1808 the whole of this immense
sum had vanished!"</p>

<p>In June, 1812, came the declaration of war
with Great Britain. The news occasioned
considerable excitement in Brooklyn, whose
middle-aged men retained a lively recollection
of the British occupation. In the "Star" of
July 8 appeared this announcement: "A new
company of Horse or Flying Artillery is lately
raised in this vicinity, under the command of
Captain John Wilson. This company promises,
under the able management of Captain
Wilson, to equal, if not excel, any company in
the State. The Artillerists of Captain Barbarin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
are fast progressing in a system of discipline
and improvement, which can alone in
the hour of trial render courage effectual.
We understand this company have volunteered
their services to Government, and are accepted.
The Riflemen of Captain Stryker
and the Fusileers of Captain Herbert are respectable
in number and discipline. The
county of Kings is in no respect behind her
neighbors in military patriotism."</p>

<p>The Fusileers wore green "coatees" and
Roman leather caps. The green frocks of the
Rifles were trimmed with yellow fringe, a
feature of the costume which is reputed to
have originated the appellation "Katydids."
In August the Artillery practiced at a target,
and John S. King won a medal.</p>

<p>Two years elapsed before Brooklyn was
actually threatened with war. In 1814 the
fear that the British fleet might, as in the
Revolutionary descent, land at Gravesend,
was naturally entertained. The committee of
defense decided to build two fortified camps
on Brooklyn Heights and on the heights of
Harlem. Volunteers for labor on local and
suburban defenses were called for, and there
was a patriotic response. A company of students
from Columbia Academy, Bergen, N.&nbsp;J.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
performed work on the Brooklyn Heights <span class="locked">fortifications.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
The Long Island defenses extended
from the Wallabout to Fort Greene,
to Bergen's Heights (on Jacob Bergen's property),
and to Fort Lawrence.</p>

<p>On the 9th of August, 1814, General Mapes,
of New York, with a body of volunteers, broke
ground for the intrenchments at Fort Greene.
The work was carried on day by day by a
different corps of volunteers. One day the
labor would be performed by the tanners and
curriers and the veteran corps of artillery; on
another day, in happy unison, would be seen
working, side by side, a brigade of infantry,
a military association of young men, the Hamilton
Society, and students of medicine; on
another, a delegation from Flatbush would be
seen engaged earnestly on the work; on another,
the people of Flatlands would be armed
with pick and shovel; then Gravesend dug in
the trenches. Irishmen were not to be outdone;
they proved their patriotism and love
of liberty by volunteering, 1200 strong, to
labor in the cause. Then the burghers from
New Utrecht gave a helping hand. The free
colored people gladly gave their aid. Jamaica
came, headed by Dominie Schoonmaker, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
with them came the principal of the academy,
with his pupils. Workmen came from New
York, Newark, Paulus Hook, and Morris
County, N.&nbsp;J. A company came from Hanover
Township, headed by their pastor, Rev.
Dr. Phelps, and labored for a day upon these
fortifications. So, too, the members of the
Baptist Church in New York came, with their
pastor, Rev. Dr. Archibald Macloy, and did a
day's work. Rev. Dr. Macloy was the father
of Congressman Macloy, who ably represented
the seventh ward of New York and a part of
Kings County before the late civil war.</p>

<p>The erection of the defenses of Brooklyn
was thus not a local affair. It was one in
which the neighboring cities, towns, and States
took part. The people were enthusiastic.
The Grand Lodge of Masons enlisted in the
service, and the watchword of the day was:
"The Master expects every Mason to do his
duty." Old Fortitude Lodge, which still
exists, rendered a day's service. A company
of ladies came from New York, forming a
procession, with music, marched to Fort
Greene, and used the shovel and the spade for
several hours. The people had one mind and
were actuated by one purpose. The work
advanced rapidly, for, as in the days of Nehemiah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the "people had a mind to work," and
their efforts were crowned with success.
These were the times when the people willingly
gave their money for the good of the
country, without expecting to receive it again
with compound interest.</p>

<p>Early in September the works were completed.
The Twenty-second Brigade of Infantry,
composed of 1750 men, was stationed
within the lines. Heavy artillery was mounted.
Brigadier General Jeremiah Johnson was in
command. He was a natural soldier, and possessed
every element of character necessary to
lead a brigade. Stern and unflinching in the
performance of duty, he yet had a warm and
generous heart, which led him to take an
active interest in the welfare of the men in his
command. The soldiers loved him, and rendered
willing obedience to his orders. Being
a resident of Brooklyn, he knew or was known
by most of his men personally.</p>

<p>At the fort on Cobble Hill worked military
companies under command of Captains
Stryker, Cowenhoven, and Herbert, the "exempts"
of Bedford and the Wallabout, Fire
Company No. 2 of Brooklyn, and a company
of Bushwick people headed by Pastor Bassett.
"Next to the duties which we owe to Heaven,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
said the Bushwick people at their meeting,
"those which belong to our country demand
our chief attention."</p>

<p>The volunteers worked with the utmost
zeal, laboring by moonlight when sunset still
left work to do. The Sixty-fourth Regiment,
of Kings County, was commanded by Francis
Titus, with Albert C. Van Brunt as second
major, and Daniel Barre as adjutant. New
Utrecht's company was headed by Captain William
Dewyre; Brooklyn's company was headed
by Captain Joseph Dean; the Wallabout and
Bushwick company, by Captain Francis Stillman;
the Gowanus company, by Captain
Peter Cowenhoven, and later by Captain John
T. Bergen; the Gravesend and Flatbush companies,
by Captain Jeremiah Lott.</p>

<p>Brooklyn was, indeed, ready, but fortunately
the crisis for which it prepared did not appear.
On the evening of February 11, 1815, came
the news of peace with Great Britain. On
the evening of the 21st Brooklyn was illuminated
in a spirit of rejoicing, and the band of
the Forty-first Regiment, then stationed in the
village, voiced the delight of the people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, various important advances had
been made by Brooklyn and her neighbors.
In 1812, Robert Fulton having made a successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
experiment with his first steamboat, the
Clermont, a steam ferry was opened between
New York City and Paulus Hook, Jersey
City. In that year Fulton and his "backer,"
Robert R. Livingston, offered to the corporation
of the city of New York a proposition to
establish a steam ferry from Fly Market Slip
to <span class="locked">Brooklyn.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The proposition was accepted,
and it was decided to run the boats from Burling
Slip. "As, however, the slip was not then
filled in, and the cost of filling was estimated
at $30,000, it was finally concluded to establish
the ferry at Beekman Slip (present Fulton
Street, New York), which was accordingly
purchased for that purpose by the corporation
from Mr. Peter Schermerhorn. Beekman Slip
at that time extended only to Pearl Street.
Fair Street, which then ran from Broadway to
Cliff Street, was extended through the block
between Cliff and Pearl streets to join Beekman
Slip. To this newly extended Fair
Street, from the East River to Broadway, and
to Partition Street, which then extended from
Broadway to the Hudson River, was given the
name of Fulton Street, in honor of the distinguished
inventor, in consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
establishing of whose steam ferry this street was
about to become a great highroad of travel
and traffic. The ferry from Fly Market Slip
was discontinued.</p>

<p>"The lease of the ferry was granted to
Robert Fulton and William Cutting (his
brother-in-law), for twenty-five years,&mdash;from
the 1st of May, 1814, to May, 1839,&mdash;at an
annual rental of $4000 for the first eighteen
years, and $4500 for the last seven years.
The lessees were to put on the ferry one steamboat
similar to the Paulus Hook ferry-boat;
to run once an hour from each side of the
ferry, from half an hour before sunrise to half
an hour after sunset; to furnish in addition
such barges, etc., as were required by previous
acts of the Legislature; and on or before the
1st of May, 1819, they were to provide another
steamboat in all respects equal to the first,
and when that was done a boat should start
from each side of the river every half hour.
As a compensation to the lessees for the increase
of expense which would be incurred in
conducting the ferry upon such an enlarged
scale, the corporation covenanted to apply to
the Legislature for a modification and increase
in the rates of ferriage; and in case the bill
passed before May 1, 1819, Messrs. Fulton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Cutting agreed to put on their second
boat at the earliest possible date thereafter.
In case of its failing to pass, they were to be
permitted to receive four cents for each and
every passenger who might choose to cross
the river in the steamboat, but the fare in
barges was to remain as it had been, viz., two
<span class="locked">cents."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The proposed bill successfully passed the
Legislature, and Fulton and Cutting formed
a stock company, called the New York and
Brooklyn Steamboat Ferry Association, with
a capital of $68,000. The first steam ferry-boat,
called the Nassau, began running on
Sunday, May 10, 1814. "This noble boat,"
said the Long Island "Star," "surpassed the
expectations of the public in the rapidity of
her movements. Her trips varied from five to
twelve minutes, according to tide and weather....
Carriages and wagons, however crowded,
pass on and off the boat with the same facility
as in passing a bridge. There is a spacious
room below the deck where the passengers
may be secure from the weather, etc." On
one of the first day's trips an engineer was
fatally hurt.</p>

<p>The Nassau made forty trips on the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Sunday, and became a useful and popular
institution. She was used after business hours
for pleasure excursions on the river. The
plan of construction was that of a double boat,
with the wheel in the centre, the engine-house
on deck and the passenger cabin in one of the
hulls. Peter Coffee, the first pilot, died in
1876, aged ninety-nine years. One end of the
deckhouse of the Nassau was occupied by a
pensioner of Fulton's, who sold candies and
cakes.</p>

<p>While the Nassau was in operation the
horse ferry-boats were also used on the Fulton
Ferry. These horse ferry-boats were peculiar
craft. The first horse-boats were single-enders,
and were compelled to turn around in crossing
the river. Subsequently double-enders
were used. All these boats had two hulls,
about twenty feet apart and covered over by a
single deck. Between these hulls were placed
the paddle-wheels, working upon the shafting
propelled by horses.</p>

<p>"By an invention of Mr. John G. Murphy,
father of ex-Senator Henry C. Murphy, the
managers of these boats were enabled to reverse
their machinery without changing the
position of the horses. The steamboat was
very popular with the public. Owing to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
success there was soon a very marked desire
in both cities for the addition of the second
steamboat, in accordance with the terms of
the contract made by the lessees with the city
of New York. Objection was made by the
lessees on the ground of additional expense,
and boats run by horse power were substituted.
In 1815 Robert Fulton died. Mr. Cutting,
who had lived in New York, removed to
Brooklyn, and died at his residence on the
Heights in 1821. The winter of 1821&ndash;22 was
one of the most severe in the history of the
country. The ferries were obstructed by enormous
quantities of floating ice. Great cakes
became jammed between the double hulls, and
travel was practically suspended. Brooklyn
had grown rapidly, and an uproar arose in
which the ferry management was roundly assailed.
Who can tell but it was here that the
original idea of the East River Bridge was
first born? In 1827 a steamboat similar to
the Nassau, and called the William Cutting,
was put on the ferry, but even this did not
satisfy the public, who were eagerly seeking
more extended accommodations. In 1833
Messrs. David Leavitt and Silas Butler secured
a controlling interest in the stock of the
company, and sought to meet the anticipations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the people by adding two new steamboats,
the Relief and the Olive Branch. Unlike
their predecessors, these boats had single hulls
and side wheels. Subsequently agitation in
the southern part of Brooklyn led to the establishment
of the South Ferry."</p>

<p>In 1817, the Loisian Academy, which had
been started four years before, received a
salaried teacher, and was removed to the small
frame house on Concord and Adams streets,
where Public School No. 1 was afterward
built.</p>

<p>Brooklyn began soon after the Revolution
to think seriously of the matter of incorporation
as a village. On January 8, 1816, a public
meeting was held at the public house of
Lawrence Brown, "to take into consideration
the proposed application for an incorporation
of Brooklyn. A committee, consisting of
Thomas Everit, Alden Spooner, Joshua Sands,
the Reverend John Ireland, and John Doughty,
met the following day at the house of H.&nbsp;B.
Pierrepont. On April 12th the act incorporating
the village passed the Legislature."</p>

  <p class="in0 center smaller"><em>Built in 1827</em></p>
</div></div>

<p>The section of the town of Brooklyn, commonly
known by the name of the Fire District,
and contained within the following bounds,
namely: "Beginning at the public landing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
south of Pierrepont's distillery, formerly the
property of Philip Livingston, deceased, on the
East River, thence running along the public
road leading from said landing to its intersection
with Red Hook Lane, thence along said
Red Hook Lane to where it intersects the
Jamaica Turnpike Road, thence a northeast
course to the head of the Walleboght mill
pond, thence through the centre of said mill
pond to the East River, and thence down
the East River to the place of beginning,"&mdash;was
incorporated as a village, by the name of
the Village of Brooklyn; and by the act the
village was constituted a road district, and
declared exempt from the superintendence of
the commissioners of highways of the town
of Brooklyn, and the Trustees of the village
were invested with all the powers over the
road district, and subjected to all the duties
in relation thereto which by law were given
to or enjoined upon the said commissioners,
<span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The Trustees were required to make a survey
and map of the village, to be kept by the
clerk, subject to the inspection of the people,
"in order that no resident might plead ignorance
of the permanent plan to be adopted for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
opening, laying out, leveling, and regulating
the streets of said village." In pursuance of
the requirements of this law, the Trustees
caused to be made a survey and map of the
village, which was adopted by them on the
8th of April, 1819. By a law passed in 1824,
the Trustees were authorized to "widen and
alter all public roads, streets, and highways,
already laid out ... to such convenient
breadth, not exceeding sixty feet, as they should
judge fit;" also to lay out new roads and
streets. In 1827 the village was divided into
five districts.</p>

<p>The first Trustees of the village were Andrew
Mercein, John Garrison, John Doughty,
John Seaman, and John Dean.</p>

<p>The first named of these Trustees appears
as one of the principal founders of a Sunday
School which was "in operation in the village
of Brooklyn" in 1816. This school seems to
have been designed and operated on broad
grounds. While combining "moral and religious
instruction with ordinary school learning,"
parents or guardians were privileged to
say "what catechism" they wished the children
to study. As a result of this school movement
the Brooklyn Sunday School Union
Society was afterward organized. The school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
met for a time in Thomas Kirk's printing-office
on Adams Street, but found the schoolhouse
quarters on the same street to be more
desirable.</p>

<p>Previous to 1814 there were two markets in
Brooklyn: one at the foot of the old Ferry
Street (which began to acquire the name Fulton
Street, after the steamboats began running
and Fulton Street had been named on the
New York side); the other at the foot of Main
Street. Both were taken down in 1814.</p>

<p>The Long Island Bank was incorporated in
1824, with a capital of $300,000, divided into
6000 shares. In the same year the Brooklyn
Fire Insurance Company came into existence.</p>

<p>On the village map adopted April 8, 1819,
sixty-seven streets appear, besides a number of
alleys. Several of the streets were sixty feet
wide. Doughty Street was the narrowest, being
only twenty feet wide.</p>

<p>In 1820 the population of the town had increased
to 7175. The village population was
5210.</p>

<p>In 1822 there were four distilleries in the
town, which at that time contained but little
over 7000 inhabitants. This was a distillery
to every 1750 inhabitants. All the grocers
appear to have sold liquors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
In 1826 the population of the village was
about 9000. The sum of the excise fees paid
over to the overseers of the poor in that year
was $3627, the significance of which large
amount need not be pointed out.</p>

<p>In 1824 a bill was introduced into the Senate,
by John Lefferts, to organize a board of
health in the village of Brooklyn. The act
constituted the Trustees a board of health.
By its provisions the president and clerk of
the village became the officers of the board.
The president's salary was fixed at $150 per
annum, and the physician appointed by the
board received $200 yearly.</p>

<p>The introduction of swill milk into the city
appears to belong to a later period. It became
the practice for milk-dealers to send to the
various distilleries and purchase swill, which
they fed to their cows. The stables were generally
long, low buildings divided into narrow
stalls, and afforded accommodation for forty
or fifty cows. The swill cost one shilling a
hogshead, and was fed hot to the cows. The
principal distilleries were Cunningham's on
Front and Washington streets; Manley's, corner
of Tillary and Gold streets; Birdsall's, John
A. Cross's, and Wilson's. The two latter were
at the Wallabout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
In 1824 the real estate of Brooklyn was
assessed at $2,111,390, and the personal property
at $438,690; making a total of $2,550,080.</p>

<p>On the 14th of January, 1830, the Supervisors
of the county purchased the poor-house
farm at Flatbush. On the 9th of July, 1831,
the corner-stone of the building was laid, on
which occasion an address was delivered by
General Jeremiah Johnson, who afterwards became
Mayor. He served as Supervisor continuously
from 1800 to 1822, and distinguished
himself in the War of 1812, a part of the time
being in command of the fortifications on Fort
Greene.</p>

<p>The expense of supporting the poor of
the town of Brooklyn during the year 1830
was $7233.13. The taxes for all expenses
amounted to only sixty cents on every hundred
dollars of valuation of real and personal
property.</p>

<p>The items of village expense as estimated
August 18, 1830, were as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

On the 2d of September, 1830, the Kings
County Temperance Society was formed at
Flatbush. The Hon. Leffert Lefferts was
elected president.</p>

<p>The population of the town as ascertained
by the census of 1830 was 15,292. The village
contained about two thirds of the town
population.</p>

<p>Furman, the indefatigable collector of statistics,
says that in 1832 Brooklyn (the village)
was divided into five districts, which together
contained 12,302 inhabitants. In the village
there were 110 licensed and 68 unlicensed
taverns. This was at the rate of one tavern
to every 69 persons. The second district appears
to have enjoyed the privilege of having
the most taverns. It contained 79 in a population
of 2801, or one to every 36 inhabitants.
In view of the fact that the proportion of
saloons to population to-day is one to every
225 persons, those rash debaters who persist
in finding a movement toward ruin in modern
life may find the figures significant.</p>

<p>An interesting glimpse of Brooklyn as it
appeared in 1820 is furnished by Guy's well-known
picture, painted from a Front Street
window, and showing a cluster of houses in
the heart of the village. The scene is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
winter, and the figures in the foreground snow
are in most instances likenesses of people of
the day. The Brooklyn Institute is in possession
of the picture. At the time of the fire
which, in 1890, destroyed the Institute building,
then on Washington Street, and since
completely obliterated to make way for the
Bridge approach, it was slightly damaged; but
it remains one of the most interesting memorials
of an interesting period. According to
the key published in Stiles, the picture represents
stores and dwellings of Thomas W.
Birdsall, Abiel Titus, Edward Coope, Geo.
Fricke, Diana Rapalje, Mrs. Middagh, Benjamin
Meeker, Mrs. Chester, Robert Cunningham,
Jacob Hicks, Joshua Sands, Augustus
Graham, Burdett Stryker, Selah Smith, and
Dr. Ball, as well as the figures of Mrs. Harmer,
Mrs. Guy, Jacob Patchen, and Judge John
Garrison.</p>

<p>Diana Rapalje, a daughter of Garrett Rapalje,
was one of the prominent figures in the
village, formerly a "favorite in Presidential
circles at Washington, and latterly an eccentric
of haughty bearing." Her house was
bought by Colonel Alden Spooner, who printed
the "Star" under its roof. Near the ferry
stairs was the house of William Furman, overseer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the poor, who was one of the founders
of the Catherine Street Ferry, and served as
the first judge of the county between 1808 and
1823. He served in the state Legislature, and
filled other important commercial and political
offices. His son, Gabriel Furman, was
the author of the "Notes" on the antiquities
of Long Island, which have been so useful to
later writers. At Birdsall tavern, on the Fulton
Road, people bought the New York papers,
and Quakers made it a stopping-place. Near
at hand was the house of Henry Dawson, who
ran the "sixpenny boats." In a low stone
house lived "the gentlemen Hicks," and in
the same region to the south were "Milk"
Hicks and "Spetler" Hicks, other prominent
members of a family whose name is closely
associated with the early history of the Heights.
Here also were the Middagh and Pierrepont
properties, which were greatly improved by a
street plan originated by Hezekiah Pierrepont.
On the Middagh estate was a house
built by Thomas Kirk for a home and printing-office,
and afterward occupied by George L.
Bird, the editor of the "Patriot." To this
house, too, came James Harper, the grandfather
of the distinguished publishers, Harper
and Brothers.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
John Doughty occupied the house formerly
owned by Diana Rapalje. Doughty was intimately
connected with Brooklyn's village life,
as fireman, assessor, town clerk, overseer of
highways, president of the fire department,
school-committee-man, and collector of the
village. A picturesque figure was Jacob
Patchen, a pungent, unmanageable man, conspicuous
in the village life by his obstinacy
and determination.</p>

<p>Over the wheelwright shop of George Smith,
opposite the lower corner of Hicks Street, was
the court-room of Judge Garrison. Garrison
was born at Gravesend in 1764. He served
as fireman, trustee, school commissioner, and
justice. Joralemon's Lane was a rough country
road, at the foot of which had been Pierrepont's
Anchor gin distillery, which was converted
about 1819 into a candle-factory, and
again became a distillery. The road had been
laid out by Peter Remsen and Philip Livingston.
The site of the present City Hall was
then an open field, while the site of the county
court house was occupied by a famous resort
known as the Military Garden.</p>

<p>The Pierrepont mansion stood at the foot
of Montague Street. It was built by John
Cornell, and became Pierrepont property in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
1802. Hezekiah Pierrepont was a dignified
and influential member of a community in
which his exertions were always for broad and
public-spirited plans. Teunis Joralemon, who
had been a harness-maker in Flatbush, bought
part of the Livingston estate, on which he
practiced market gardening. He filled the
offices of justice of the peace and Trustee, and
other offices, but was of a temperament antipodal
to that of Pierrepont, hotly opposing new
streets, especially through his own property,
and scorning the distinction of having Joralemon
Street named after him. Another prominent
estate was that of the Fleets. The name
of Bergen is prominently associated with the
progress of the village. At Bedford Corners
were the Meseroles, Ryersons, Lefferts, Vandervoorts,
Suydams, Tiebouts, Cowenhovens,
and other old families.</p>

<p>In December, 1821, the subject of removing
the court house from Flatbush to Brooklyn
was agitated in the papers, and on the 21st of
January, 1825, a meeting was held at Duflons,
whereat a committee was appointed to obtain
the removal of the court house and jail from
Flatbush to Brooklyn. In 1826 the subject
was brought to the attention of the Legislature,
and that body passed an act that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
court of common pleas and general sessions
should alternate between Flatbush and the
Apprentices' Library Building in Cranberry
Street, then just finished. The court of common
pleas in those days corresponded to the
county court of our time. The county clerk's
office was removed to Brooklyn in March,
1819. The county court began to hold sessions
in Brooklyn in January, 1827.</p>

<p>The Trustees of the village of Brooklyn
deemed a debtors' prison a very important
addition to the city. On the 19th of February,
1829, Joseph Sprague, president of the Board
of Trustees, made a report on the subject of
fitting up under the market a prison-room for
debtors. In accordance therewith a lockup
was provided and cells built under the market.
These cells were oftentimes crowded, and but
little provision was made for the comfort of
the occupants. The Bridge approach now
passes over the old lockup.</p>

<p>During those early days prisoners were also
confined in cells in the almshouse, then situated
on the south side of Nassau Street, between
Bridge and Jay streets. The building
is still standing, and has been converted into
dwellings.</p>

<p>The agitation relative to the removal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
court house still continued. The Supervisors
took the matter in hand. They were empowered
in 1829 to raise by tax a sum of money
for the purchase of lots, and the erection of a
suitable building in Brooklyn to accommodate
the courts and jail when completed. It may
well be supposed that Flatbush did not relish
the idea of the removal, and, being anxious
to retain her precedence among the towns,
her representatives strenuously opposed the
change, and their votes for a short time delayed
the inevitable. The elements, however,
aided those who urged the removal, by the
burning of the jail and court house, as heretofore
stated, and the way was opened for a new
building. The next year an act was passed
by the Legislature providing for the building
of a jail and court house in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of this law three commissioners
were chosen to purchase a suitable
site for the buildings. The act also provided
that when the court house was finished and
ready for occupancy, a certificate to that effect
should be obtained from the first judge of the
county, and that thereafter all terms of the
court of common pleas and general sessions
of the peace should be held in the new building,
and that all processes and writs should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
made returnable thereat. It might be stated
that subsequent to the fire at Flatbush, and
prior to the occupation of the new building,
the courts were temporarily held at the Apprentices'
Library, and were removed to Hall's
Exchange Building. Baily, writing in 1840,
says: "The Kings County courts are held in
the large building called the Exchange, situated
on the corner of Cranberry and Fulton
streets. It is a plain brick building without
any extraordinary architectural beauty." The
court-room was on the second floor. On the
first floor of the building was Bokee &amp; Clem's
hardware store. David A. Bokee was an influential
politician of the Whig school. His
store for a time was the headquarters of the
Whigs, who would assemble almost daily for
consultation. Bokee ran for Mayor in 1843
against Joseph Sprague, the latter being
elected by 311 majority. The Whigs elected
him an Alderman, and he served during the
years 1840&ndash;43, 1845&ndash;48. He was state senator
in 1848 and 1849, congressman from
1849 to 1851, and naval officer from 1851 to
1853. Mr. Bokee was one of the leading
members of the First Baptist Church.</p>

<p>The Apprentices' Library Building, where
the courts were held, was a notable structure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
One of the principal sources of its fame arose
from the fact that its corner-stone was laid on
the 4th of July, 1825, by that earnest and zealous
friend of American institutions, Lafayette.
It was taken down in 1858 to make room
for the Armory, which was afterward sold.
Previous to the erection of the City Hall it
served as the municipal building. The Common
Council and Board of Education met
there. The municipal court also held its sessions
in the building, and it afforded room for
the post office and county clerk's office. On
the 1st of May, 1828, an act was passed by the
Legislature providing for the erection of a
fire-proof county clerk's office in Brooklyn.
The Legislature, on the 25th of April, 1833,
passed an act for the erection of a court house
and jail in Kings County. By this act Losee
Van Nostrand, Joseph Moser, and Peter Canaver
were appointed commissioners to purchase
a suitable site or sites in the village of
Brooklyn for the same. To defray the expenses
to be incurred in erecting the buildings,
the supervisors were authorized to create a
public stock to the amount of $25,000. A
building committee of five persons was directed
to be appointed by the Supervisors of the
county, and the president and Trustees of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
village, within sixty days after the passage of
the act. The act also provided that when the
court house and jail, or either of them, should
be so far completed as to permit either of
them being used for the purpose intended,
that the first judge of the county should sign
a declaration to that effect, and file the same
in the office of the clerk of said county. The
clerk thereupon was to publish the notice in
the papers printed in the county, and from
and after this publication the terms of the
court of common pleas and general sessions
should be held in the court-room, and from
and after such declaration relating to the jail
it should become the common jail of the
county. This act was amended February 17,
1834, so as to declare that the second section
of the act of 1833 authorized the Supervisors
to create stock, not only for the purchase of a
site, but also for erecting buildings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the village had been flourishing
in other directions. Its general growth was
marked not only by the increase in population,
but by the increase in the number of
commercial institutions, churches, and schools.
A second bank was chartered. A "night boat"
began running on the ferry. There was an
effort to establish a theatre; and a building for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
this purpose, subsequently abandoned, was
erected, in 1828, on Fulton Street, between
Nassau and Concord. The Brooklyn "Evening
Star" began daily publication, and continued
to be a daily paper for six months,
when insufficient patronage made it necessary
to suspend daily issue. Stone walks were laid.
The movement resulting in the formation of
the Brooklyn Gaslight Company was begun.
A second bank was chartered. A temperance
society, a dispensary, a tract society, and a
literary association (the Hamilton) were organized.
There began to be talk of water-works
and of railroads. Fulton Street was widened,
boats appeared on the South Ferry, and the
boom in real estate indicated the growing popularity
of the village.</p>

<p>The movement for the incorporation of
Brooklyn as a city met the determined opposition
of a large proportion of New York's
inhabitants, who maintained that the propriety
of natural growth demanded that Brooklyn and
New York should become one city. From
the earliest days of their common existence
New York had grudged Brooklyn an independent
life. The "water-rights" quarrels occupy
much space in the early records. Under the
early charter New York claimed ownership in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the East River, and of Brooklyn land to low-water
mark, and afterward to high-water
mark. This brought many disputes in the
matter of ferry <span class="locked">rights,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and the spirit of this
early dispute survived in the later attitude of
New York. In the year 1824 the town on
Manhattan Island received an income of over
eight thousand dollars from the East River
ferries. The legislative provision for Brooklyn's
harbor-master had been declared to be
an encroachment on the rights of New <span class="locked">York.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Despite strong opposition, Brooklyn triumphed
at Albany, and in April, 1834, became
a full-fledged city.</p>

<p>The act of incorporation erected the city of
Brooklyn from the village and town of Brooklyn,
dividing the city into nine wards. By
Section 50 of this act, provision is made
against closing or altering streets "within the
first seven wards, or fire and watch district,
set apart as such by the owners thereof, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and graded, leveled, paved, or macadamized,
and against closing or altering streets in said
city laid out and opened and used as such for
ten years from the passage of this act, without
the consent of the Common Council."
The act was otherwise conservative in adjusting
the new plans to existing conditions.</p>

<p>The government of the city was vested in a
mayor and a board of aldermen, the latter, to
the number of two from each ward, to be
elected annually. The selection of a mayor
was conferred upon the Aldermen, whose first
choice was George Hall.</p>

<p>Hall was born in New York, in 1795, in the
year preceding his father's purchase of the
Valley Grove Farm at Flatbush. He was
educated at Erasmus Hall, and chose to follow
his father's trade of painter and glazier. He
made friends, and established a good business
position. In 1826 he became a Trustee in the
third district of the city. He became president
of the village, and in 1833 was reëlected
after a hot contest, the bitterness of which
resulted from Hall's support of the movement
to exclude hogs from the public streets, and to
prevent the unlicensed selling of liquor in
groceries and elsewhere. The defeat of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was called the "Whig-Hog-Rum" party was
announced amid much excitement.</p>

<p>In the July following the choice of Hall
as Mayor of the new city, it was resolved to
raise $50,000 for the purchase of ground for a
city hall. General agreement fixed upon the
junction of Fulton and Joralemon streets as
sufficiently central. In January of the following
year (1835) a committee of the corporation
reported favorably on low lands of the
Wallabout for a city park, and before the close
of the year ground was selling for $1000 an
acre.</p>

<p>In May the Aldermen chose Jonathan
Trotter for Mayor. Trotter was an Englishman
who had been in this country since 1818,
and who in 1828 had opened a leather-dressing
factory in Brooklyn. He became an
Alderman, representing the fourth ward, in
1834.</p>

<p>In 1834 the total valuation was $15,642,290;
in 1835 it was $26,390,151; in 1836 it was
$32,428,942; and in 1837, $26,895,074. Previous
to 1838, the assessments were made by
wards, and it is impossible to give the aggregates.
The valuation and total taxation for
subsequent years, up to 1860, are as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 1835 there were thirteen churches in
Brooklyn, as follows: St. Ann's, St. John's,
and Christ Church, Episcopalian; Sands
Street, York Street, and Washington Street,
Methodist, and the African Methodist; First,
Second, and Third Presbyterian; St. James',
Roman Catholic; Nassau Street, Baptist;
and Joralemon Street, Dutch Reformed. St.
Luke's (then Trinity) Church, in Clinton Avenue,
was organized in this year. The population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
was 24,310, making a church for each
1807 persons. In 1847 there were fifty-two
churches in the city, or one to each 1442
inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September, the plan of the
City Hall was submitted to the Common Council
and approved. The corner-stone, as originally
planned, was laid April 28, 1836, by the
Mayor. The building, if it had been completed
in accordance with first intentions, would have
rendered unnecessary the building of the new
Court House and municipal buildings. It
was started during the inflation times of 1836.
The era of wild speculation came to an end.
The bubble burst, and work upon the city
building was suspended on August 7, 1837.
The walls, which had risen above the basement,
stood for many years, when the work was resumed
and carried to completion on a much
smaller scale. The City Hall, as originally
planned, was intended to cover the entire
square in front of the present edifice.</p>

<p>On the 4th of August, 1836, the Apprentices'
Library, having been purchased by the
corporation of the city for $11,000, was officially
named the City Buildings.</p>

<p>During the time the Common Council met
in the City Buildings, Whigs and Democrats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were very belligerent. The cause of the trouble
grew out of the election for Alderman of
the seventh ward. That ward then embraced
the area of the present seventh, eleventh,
nineteenth, and twentieth wards. The charter
election was held in the public schoolhouse
on Classen Avenue, between Flushing and
Park avenues, on the 11th of March, 1843, and
resulted in a tie between John A. Cross and
Zebulon Chadbourne, the former being a Whig
and the latter a Democrat. A protracted lawsuit
followed. Albert H. Osborn, whose seat
was to be filled, held over, and ever after the
people declared that his initials, A.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;O., stood
for Alderman Hold Over.</p>

<p>The contention ran high, and bitterness and
rancor marked the deliberations of the Aldermen.
At a regular meeting of the Board, held
at the City Buildings May 8, a separation took
place between the Whig and Democratic members,
occasioned by the fight between Cross
and Chadbourne for the seat from the seventh
ward. The Whig members retired to Hull's
Exchange Buildings, whilst the Democrats
remained in possession of the City Buildings,
and made their appointments. The Whigs
did the same.</p>

<p>On the 15th of May a writ of mandamus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was served on Alfred G. Stevens, who had
been appointed clerk of the Common Council
by the Democrats May 8. His election was
secured by the vote of A.&nbsp;H. Osborne, without
whose holding over the Board would have
been a tie.</p>

<p>On the 23d of May the mandamus which
had been obtained by Worthington Hodgkinson,
the clerk appointed by the Whigs, was
argued before the Supreme Court. On the
9th of July, 1843, the motion to displace Stevens
and substitute Hodgkinson was decided
and denied by the Supreme Court, Chief Justice
Nelson and Greene C. Bronson presiding.
The decision did not suit the Whigs, and was
carried to the Supreme Court at Albany, and
argued October 21, 1843. Abraham Crist
appeared for the relator, and John Greenwood
for the defendant. Shortly afterwards the
court decided in favor of the defendant.</p>

<p>The matter was again argued November 24
before Judge Kent in New York, on a motion
to obtain the books and papers of the Common
Council in the hands of Mr. Stevens.
On the 27th Judge Kent again decided in
favor of Mr. Stevens.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December the Whig Aldermen
were arrested for misdemeanor in neglecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to perform their duty. The complaint was
abandoned. On the 5th of December the
grand jury found bills of indictment against
the several Whig Aldermen for neglecting to
serve as members of the Common Council.
At this time Seth Low (grandfather of the
president of Columbia College) represented
the fourth ward in the Common Council.
The indictment against the Whig Aldermen
grew out of an effort on their part to indict
Mayor Sprague. It was a case of the biter
being bitten. The grand jury refused to indict
the Mayor, and indicted his accusers.
The indictment was, however, not pressed to
trial.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Jamaica Railroad had obtained
permission to occupy Atlantic Street,
and other projects matured. The population
of the city had, in 1835, reached 24,310, showing
a gain of 9013 in fifteen years.</p>

<p>Trotter was reëlected Mayor, and was succeeded
by Jeremiah Johnson, a man whose
contemporaries revered him, and whose name
occupies, and must always occupy, a high
place in the annals of the city. General Johnson
was reëlected, and was succeeded by Cyrus
P. Smith, who was elected by vote of the people,
and who also was reëlected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The fluster in the real-estate market was
paralleled by the financial excitement, which
resulted in the suspension of specie payments
by the three banks of the city. The year of
General Johnson's reëlection was one of general
business depression, but the community
rallied quickly from the blow inflicted by disordered
markets.</p>

<p>In 1841 the Democrats of the county received
representation in a new newspaper, the
"Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat."
The movement for the establishment
of the "Eagle" was led by Henry C. Murphy,
with whom Richard Adams Locke was
associated in the editorship. The first number
appeared in October, and the Democrats
were not loth to give the lusty young
journal full credit for the success of the campaign,
in which its voice gave no uncertain
sound.</p>

<p>Directing the helm of the "Eagle" enterprise
was the clear-sighted, practical genius of
Isaac Van Anden, who soon came into complete
control of the paper, and remained sole
proprietor until the year 1872. The "Eagle"
had its days of adversity; but it had a field,
and it had vitality, and its growth was sure
and steady. Following Murphy in its early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
editorship were William B. Marsh, Walt
<span class="locked">Whitman,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> S.&nbsp;G. Arnold (under whose editorial
leadership the name of the paper was
abbreviated to "Brooklyn Daily Eagle"), and
Henry McCloskey. In 1861 McCloskey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
succeeded by Thomas Kinsella, who gave force
and distinction to the editorial page of the
flourishing paper. Kinsella died in 1884,
after having made himself a power in the community.
He was succeeded by his first lieutenant
on the "Eagle" staff, that graceful
writer and orator, Andrew McLean, who afterward
took the editorship of the Brooklyn "Citizen."
That the "Eagle" was destined to be
lucky with its editors, received further indication
in the appearance of St. Clair McKelway
at the post of command. Mr. McKelway's
brilliant gifts as a speaker and as a writer have
given to him peculiar prominence in the social,
artistic, and political life of the city and the
State.</p>

<p>The policy of the "Eagle" has been independently
Democratic from the outset, a policy
which has fostered, as it has been favored by,
a singularly representative constituency. The
paper is now controlled by the Eagle Association,
of which Colonel William Hester is the
president, William Van Anden Hester is secretary,
and Harry S. Kingsley is treasurer.
Its business management, like its editorial
management,&mdash;if these may consistently be
separated,&mdash;has been aggressive and liberal,
and goes far toward explaining the present
national reputation of the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Henry C. Murphy, who had, as we have
seen, taken so important a part in the starting
of the "Eagle," was a young Democrat of
prominence in the county. Born in the village
of Brooklyn, Murphy had been educated
at Columbia College, where he distinguished
himself as a writer as well as in general scholarship,
and was admitted to the bar in 1833.
During his student years, he had taken part
in debates in the Young Men's Literary
Association, which afterward became the Hamilton
Literary Association, with Murphy as
president. To this association belongs the
honor of popularizing the lyceum lecture system,
which afterward became so potent a factor
in American civilization, and which in this
city represented the beginning of the Brooklyn
Lyceum and the Brooklyn Institute. In
1834 he was appointed assistant corporation
counsel of the city, and in the following year
he formed a legal partnership with the leading
lawyer of the city, John A. Lott. This firm,
which Judge Vanderbilt afterward joined, won
great influence in the city, with whose early
politics it was so closely connected.</p>

<p>In 1842 Murphy was chosen Mayor of
Brooklyn. He was then but thirty years of
age. His administration was forcible throughout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and consistently resulted in his election
to Congress, of which he was one of the
youngest members. He was a candidate for
reëlection, but was defeated by Henry L. Seaman.
In the State Constitutional Convention
of 1846, he was a delegate from Kings
County, with Tunis G. Bergen and Conrad
Schwackhammer, and in the autumn of the
same year he was again elected to Congress
by a large vote.</p>

<p>Upon the election of Buchanan, Murphy
was appointed Minister to the Hague. On
his return to this country he was elected to
the state Senate as an avowed champion of
the Union cause. In the later political life of
Brooklyn, Murphy took an active interest; and
local enterprises, such as the bridge and various
railroads, claimed his attention and support.
He made important historical collections,
wrote valuable contributions to local
history, edited the "Journal" of Dankers and
Sluyter, and was a leader in the establishment
of the Long Island Historical Society.</p>

<p>Murphy was succeeded as Mayor of Brooklyn
by Joseph Sprague. The city had now
30,000 population, and thirty-five miles of
paved and lighted streets. The Atlantic Dock
Company had been incorporated. Thirty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
churches opened their doors on Sunday. A
line of stages ran from the ferry to East
Brooklyn, and soon afterward a line was established
between Fulton and South ferries. In
the year of Sprague's election 570 new buildings
were finished or in course of erection.
During Sprague's second term the Brooklyn
City Hospital was incorporated.</p>

<p>Sprague was succeeded by Thomas G. Talmadge,
who was followed by Francis Burdett
Stryker. In March, 1848, gaslight came into
use.</p>

<p>It was in the same year that Augustus
Graham indelibly wrote his name in the annals
of Brooklyn, by his munificent gifts to
the Brooklyn City Hospital, and to the establishment
of the Brooklyn Institute in the
building on Washington Street built for the
Brooklyn Lyceum.</p>

<p>A fire which took place in September destroyed
three churches, the post-office, two
newspaper offices, and other property to the
value of a million and a half of dollars, and
might have been more disastrous had not the
flames been checked by the destruction of
buildings in their path.</p>

<p>Edward Copeland was elected Mayor in
1849. Cypress Hills Cemetery had been established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in 1848. In the following year the
Cemetery of the Evergreens was incorporated.
The ground for Greenwood Cemetery had already
been secured.</p>

<p>The idea of a bridge to connect New York
and Brooklyn, which had occasionally been
discussed at earlier times, was now seriously
taken up. The water front assumed a constantly
increasing activity.</p>

<p>Copeland was followed in the mayoralty by
Samuel Smith, Conklin Brush, and Edward
C. Lambert. The latter was able to congratulate
the city on a population of 120,000, and
the position of seventh city in the Union.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn City Railroad, incorporated
in 1853, began in July of the following year
the running of street cars on Myrtle Avenue,
Fulton Street, and Fulton Avenue. In August
cars were running to Greenwood.</p>

<p>The act of May 9, 1846 (Session Laws 1846,
chapter 166), authorized the Mayor, Aldermen,
and Commonalty of the city of Brooklyn to
create a temporary loan, in addition to the
loans already authorized, not exceeding the
sum of $100,000, for the purpose of erecting a
city hall, and provision was made for the
issuance of bonds for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Legislature at their session on the 12th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of April, 1848, amended the 4th section of
the act of April 21, 1846, authorizing the Supervisors
to create a loan, and provide further
accommodations for the confinement of prisoners,
so as to read as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec. 4.</span> The Board of Supervisors of said
county, if land should be purchased, are authorized
to remove as many prisoners sentenced
to hard labor in the County Jail, as
they may deem necessary, to the lands so purchased;
to place them under such keeper or
keepers as they may appoint for that purpose,
and to employ them in erecting said penitentiary
and workhouse, or such other labor as
may be deemed expedient; and they may also
authorize and direct the superintendents of
the poor of said county to take charge of the
establishment (subject to the directions of said
Board), and provide the necessary food and
clothing for said prisoners, and for those committed
as herein next provided. And it shall
be lawful for the several magistrates and justices
of the peace in said county to commit
all offenders convicted before them of petty
causes, offenses or misdemeanors, who are in
their judgment proper subjects for the penitentiary
and workhouse in their discretion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The city court of Brooklyn was established
by an act of the Legislature, March 24, 1849.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
It had but one judge until 1870, when it was
reorganized with three.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, 1849, an act was
passed authorizing the Mayor and Common
Council to create a loan, in addition to the
loans which had already been authorized by
law, not exceeding $50,000, to complete and
finish the City Hall.</p>

<p>By virtue of the laws of 1850, chapter 23,
the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty were
authorized to create an additional loan of
$15,000, for the purpose of completing the
City Hall of Brooklyn, paying for the fences,
ornamenting the grounds belonging thereto,
and all other necessary expenses for the full
completion and protection of the same.</p>

<p>The subject of building a new court house
was again agitated in 1852. On the 17th of
September in that year a special committee
was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to
consider the matter. On the 18th of January,
1853, they reported in favor of applying to the
Legislature to carry out the work.</p>

<p>On the 29th of June, 1846, Charles G.
Taylor offered a resolution in the Board of
Supervisors declaring that it was expedient to
purchase lands for the purpose of erecting a
workhouse and penitentiary thereon, in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with the act of the Legislature passed
April 21, 1846. Charles G. Taylor, Barnet
Johnson, and James Debevoise, the committee
having the matter in charge, reported that
18 acres could be purchased at $200 per acre,
and 29 acres for $180 per acre. On the 4th
of August, 1846, a resolution was adopted that
the same should be purchased, if the titles
proved good. On the 4th of December, 1846,
Seth Low, John Skillman, and Tunis G.
Bergen were appointed a committee to present
plans and details.</p>

<p>In April, 1846, the county treasurer issued
$2000 of bonds for the erection of the Penitentiary.
In 1849 $10,000 more were issued.
The total amount of bonds issued up to March
2, 1854, was $155,000. On the 5th of June,
1855, the committee reported that the cost
thus far of the easterly and main wing was
$111,433.49.</p>

<p>The new Penitentiary was occupied as early
as January, 1854, although it was not completed
until August, 1856. The total amount
of bonds issued for the Penitentiary was
$205,000.</p>

<p>It was not until May 3, 1855, that steps
were taken to build the female wing of the
new Penitentiary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
On the 5th of April, 1853, an act was passed
by the Legislature requiring that whenever
the Penitentiary should be ready for the reception
of prisoners, the Board of Supervisors
should file a certificate thereof in the office of
the clerk of the county, and publish a notice
thereof for three weeks in one or more newspapers,
and that thereafter all persons who,
on conviction, are liable to imprisonment for
not less than thirty days, should be sent there
by the magistrates. The Penitentiary is situated
on a spot familiarly called Crow Hill,
and is bounded by Nostrand, Rogers, President,
and Carroll streets. It faces on Carroll
Street. Prisoners have been sent here from
all parts of the State, and, through the efficient
management of its wardens, it has been rendered
nearly, if not wholly, self-supporting.</p>

<p>The increase of business and the unsuitableness
of location rendered it necessary to
change the place for holding the courts. The
Legislature was again appealed to, and in 1853
an act was passed authorizing the county to
borrow a sum not to exceed $100,000, to purchase
a site, and erect buildings for such
county offices as the Board of Supervisors
might designate. Many sites were offered,
and various and diverse propositions and suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
were made. Some were anxious to
have the Court House built on Fort Greene,
holding that it would, from its elevation, give
character to the building. The matter slumbered
until October 10, 1855, when it was
again brought up and postponed indefinitely.
The difficulty of securing a suitable site now
presented itself. Seventeen lots on Vanderbilt
Avenue near Baltic Street were proposed,
and the Board resolved to purchase them.
Soon after the purchase the people, realizing
that it was not a proper place, instituted opposition.</p>

<p>When the City Hall was opened the courts
were transferred to that building. The room
long occupied by Justice Courtney was used by
the Supreme and county courts. A small
room opposite, now occupied by the Bureau of
Elections, was appropriated for the purpose of
holding special terms. The county clerk's
office occupied a part of the apartments of the
present comptroller. The surrogate's court
occupied the Court Street portion of the comptroller's
present rooms, whilst the register's
office was opposite, in the rooms of the present
auditor. The city court was held in the room
now used by the city clerk. Hall's Exchange
Building, in which the courts had been held,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was destroyed in the great fire of 1848, and
the courts were, thereupon, transferred to the
City Hall.</p>

<p>In those days the sheriff lived with his family
in the jail on Raymond Street.</p>

<p>If the city was forced to look to the building
of its penal institutions and courts of justice,
institutions of another kind were springing
into being. In 1854 the Brooklyn Female
Academy became the Packer Collegiate Institute
for Girls; and in the same year a boy's
academy was established, with the title of the
Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute.
The development of these important educational
institutions has been one of the most
gratifying incidents in the life of the city.</p>

<p>As early as 1848 there had been serious
talk of the civic union of Williamsburgh and
Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The village of Williamsburgh was incorporated
in 1827. Its boundaries then were:
"Beginning at the bay, or river, opposite to
the town of Brooklyn, and running thence
easterly along the division line between the
towns of Bushwick and Brooklyn, to the lands
of Abraham A. Remsen; thence northerly by
the same to a road or highway, at a place
called Sweed's Fly; thence by the said highway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to the dwelling-house, late of John Vandervoort,
deceased; thence in a straight line
northerly, to a small ditch or creek, against
the meadow of John Skillman; thence by said
creek to Norman's Hill; thence by the middle
or centre of Norman's Hill to the East
River; thence by the same to the place of
beginning."</p>

<p>The first officers of the Board of Trustees
were Noah Waterbury, president; Abraham
Meserole, secretary; and Lewis Sanford,
treasurer. In 1829 Williamsburgh had a
population of 1007. In 1835 Williamsburgh
and Bushwick together had a population of
3314. It was in this year that the "Williamsburgh
Gazette" was started. Within a few
years came the Williamsburgh Lyceum, the
Houston Street Ferry, the "Williamsburgh
Democrat," and a Bible Society.</p>

<p>By chapter 144 of Laws of 1850 (p. 242),
passed April 4, 1850, so much of the territory
of the city of Brooklyn as lay east of the
centre of Division Avenue, between the intersection
of South Sixth Street, in the village
of Williamsburgh, and Flushing Avenue, in
the city of Brooklyn, was annexed to the
village of Williamsburgh; the city of Brooklyn
was divided into eleven wards (therein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
described), and the Common Council of the
city was authorized, under certain restrictions
and limitations, to cause streets and avenues
to be opened and widened, and to be regulated,
graded, and paved, public squares and
parks to be opened, regulated, and ornamented,
etc., and to close up and discontinue roads,
streets, lanes, and avenues, <span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>By chapter 102 of Laws of 1835 (p. 88),
passed April 18, 1835, a portion of the town
of Bushwick&mdash;"beginning at the southeast
corner of the present village of Williamsburgh,
running thence southeasterly along the line
that divides the town of Bushwick and the
city of Brooklyn, to a turnpike road leading
from Brooklyn to Newtown and Flushing,
at a point near, and southwesterly of, the
house of Charles DeBevoise, thence running
along said road northeasterly to the crossroads,
thence northerly along the road leading
to Bushwick Church to the Williamsburgh
and Jamaica turnpike, thence northerly along
the road, passing the church, and leading to
Newtown Bridge, about twelve hundred feet,
to an abrupt angle in said road turning to the
east, thence westerly about eighteen hundred
feet until it intersects the head of navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of a branch of Bushwick Creek, thence westerly
along said branch creek, according to its
meanderings, to the main creek, which is the
present boundary of the said village of Williamsburgh,
thence southerly along the eastern
boundary line of the said village of Williamsburgh
to the place of beginning"&mdash;was
annexed to Williamsburgh, and Nicholas
Wyckoff, David Johnson, Peter Stagg, Robert
Ainslie, and John Leonard were appointed
commissioners to lay out streets.</p>

<p>In 1840 the town of Williamsburgh was
created, and eleven years later the city of
Williamsburgh was incorporated, comprising
the village of Williamsburgh. The city was
divided into three wards, and the Common
Council was authorized, under certain restrictions
and limitations, to cause streets and avenues
to be opened and widened, and public
squares and parks to be opened.</p>

<p>The city charter was drawn by S.&nbsp;M.
Meeker, counselor of the village, a lawyer,
whose name was prominent in the annals of
this section of Brooklyn for many years. Mr.
Meeker was counsel of the Williamsburgh
Savings Bank when chosen its president in
1881. He was a prime mover in the establishment
of the First National Bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Abraham J. Berry was the first Mayor of
the city of Williamsburgh, William H. Butler
being city clerk, George Thompson, attorney
and counsel, and Jas. F. Kenny, comptroller.
In the first year of the new city's life the
Farmers' and Citizens' Bank, the Williamsburgh
City Bank, the Williamsburgh City Fire
Insurance Company, and the Williamsburgh
Medical Society were incorporated. The
population was estimated at over 40,000.
Over 9000 children attended school, and there
were fifteen private schools. A year later the
Mechanics' (now the Manufacturers') National
Bank was established, and a number of new
churches appeared. There were twenty-five
Sunday-schools of different denominations.
The Young Men's Christian Association of
Williamsburgh began its career under favorable
<span class="locked">auspices.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>William Wall, elected Mayor on the Whig
ticket in 1854, was soon at swords' points with
the Aldermen, whose resolutions he vetoed
with remarkable frequency. His antagonism
toward the Aldermen led him to take an
active part with those who were urging the
consolidation of the cities of Brooklyn and
Williamsburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
The movement toward annexation was accompanied
by all of the conflict of opinion that
inevitably characterizes such movements. The
Brooklyn "Star," in March, remarked editorially:
"We know there are some amongst us
who prate of greater taxation and inequalities
in favor of Williamsburgh. There are those
in Williamsburgh who argue that Brooklyn
has greatly the advantage. We are rather
disposed to argue that it is like a well-assorted
union between man and wife, where, with
kindred feelings and objects, both have the
advantage. No matter how the property
relations may seem to be, we are convinced
that time will vindicate the advantage of the
union.</p>

<p>"We hope our members of the Legislature
will not be persuaded by individual efforts and
desires to thwart the will of three committees
clearly expressed, with Brooklyn at their head,
lifting up the loudest voice. We have taken
some pains to ascertain the public sentiment,
and it is at this day more clearly in favor of
the union than when the vote was taken."</p>

<p>The Williamsburgh "Times" warmly supported
the consolidation movement. When
the bill prepared by the Consolidation Commission
was before the Legislature for action, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"Times" said (March 24): "With the exception
of the amendment relative to the office-holders,
the bill is nearly in all respects as it
passed from the hands of the commissions.
Thus the hopes of the friends of consolidation
seem in a fair way of being realized, and after
a world of pain and trouble the parturition of
the new city is at hand. Let us trust that the
friends of this measure will not meet with
an entire disappointment. There are two
grounds for hope in this connection. Brooklyn
has been at least a little better governed
than ourselves, and a large city can be more
cheaply managed than a small one."</p>

<p>The publication of the Williamsburgh
"Times" was begun in 1848 by Aaron Smith
and George C. Bennett. Bennett, who previously
had been associated with Levi Darbee
and Isaac A. Smith in printing the Williamsburgh
"Morning <span class="locked">Post,"<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> acquired control of
the "Times," and made it a pronounced Whig
organ. In 1859 an interest in the paper was
secured by Bernard Peters, and under this
favoring partnership the paper rapidly advanced
in circulation and influence. Bernard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Peters, who subsequently became sole proprietor
of the paper, had made an important journalistic
record at Hartford, Conn., and was
already well known in Brooklyn as a Universalist
clergyman, whose ringing Union sermons
and addresses had aroused public interest
during the war period. The later history
of the "Times," under Peters' energetic editorship,
has been one of consistent progress in
public confidence. In politics the "Times"
has been Republican, while its policy, to avoid
any partisanship that might impair its value
as a newspaper, has been strongly worked out
with the notable business management of
William C. Bryant.</p>

<p>By the act of the Legislature passed in
April, 1854, all that part of the county of
Kings known as the cities of Brooklyn and
Williamsburgh and the town of Bushwick,
and bounded easterly by the town of Newtown,
Queens County, south by the towns of
New Lots, Flatbush, and New Utrecht, west
by the town of New Utrecht and the Bay of
New York, and north by the East River, was
consolidated into one municipal corporation
called the city of Brooklyn, and divided into
eighteen wards, therein described, and into the
eastern and western districts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
A year later all local distinctions in relation
to the eastern and western districts were abolished,
except as to the Fire Department.</p>

<p>George Hall, who had been first Mayor of
Brooklyn upon its incorporation as a city, became
the first Mayor of the consolidated cities
of Brooklyn and Williamsburgh. In his inaugural
address the Mayor <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is now twenty-one years since I was
called by the Common Council to preside over
the affairs of the late city of Brooklyn, then
first ushered into existence. The population of
the city at that time consisted of about 20,000
persons, residing for the most part within the
distance of about three quarters of a mile from
Fulton Ferry. Beyond this limit no streets
of any consequence were laid out, and the
ground was chiefly occupied for agricultural
purposes. The shores, throughout nearly their
whole extent, were in their natural condition,
washed by the East River and the bay. There
were two ferries, by which communication was
had with the city of New York, ceasing at
twelve o'clock at night. There were within
the city two banks, two insurance companies,
one savings bank, fifteen churches, three public
schools, and two weekly newspapers. Of
commerce and manufactures it can scarcely be
said to have had any, its business consisting
chiefly of that which was required for supplying
the wants of its inhabitants. Sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of its streets were lighted with public lamps,
of which thirteen had been supplied within
the previous year. The assessed value
of the taxable property was $7,829,684, of
which $6,457,084 consisted of real estate and
$1,372,600 of personal property.</p>

<p>"Williamsburgh was incorporated as a village
in 1827. Its growth was comparatively
slow until after the year 1840. At the taking
of the census in that year it was found to contain
5094 inhabitants, and since that time it
has advanced with almost unparalleled rapidity,
having attained a population of 30,780 in
1850. It was chartered as a city in 1851.</p>

<p>"Within the comparatively short period of
twenty-one years what vast changes have taken
place! Bushwick, from a thinly settled township,
has advanced with rapid strides, and
yesterday contained within its limits two large
villages, together numbering a population of
about 7000 persons. Williamsburgh, from a
hamlet, became a city with about 50,000 inhabitants.
Brooklyn, judging from its past
increase, yesterday contained a population of
about 145,000, and on this day&mdash;the three
places consolidated into one municipal corporation&mdash;takes
its stand as the third city in
the Empire State, with an aggregate population
of about 200,000 <span class="locked">inhabitants."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Under the new charter the Board of Aldermen
consisted of one alderman elected from
each ward. A new board of education came
into existence and held its first meeting in
February. Other incorporations were those
of the Fire Department, the Nassau Water
Company, and the Brooklyn Sunday School
Union.</p>

<p>The Williamsburgh Ferry Company had
been authorized in 1853 to build and maintain
docks, wharves, bulkheads, and piers on the
land under water in the East River, in front
of their lands in the city of Williamsburgh between
the foot of South Sixth Street and the
foot of South Eighth Street, and extending
into the river to a line not more than sixty-five
feet from the front of the largest pier on the
property.</p>

<p>The Common Council voted a subscription
of $1,000,000 to the stock of the Nassau
Water Company, on condition that the company
show $2,000,000 paid capital stock, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Aldermen afterward added $300,000 to
the subscription. In July of the following
year (1856), work on the Nassau Water Works
was begun at Reservoir Hill, Flatbush Avenue.
The occasion of breaking ground was signalized
by imposing ceremonies.</p>

<p>In his January address Mayor Hall announced
the opening of fourteen miles of new
streets, and the erection of 1034 new buildings.</p>

<p>The business of the city was rapidly increasing,
and with the annexation of Williamsburgh
the municipality needed all the accommodations
afforded in the City Hall for the transaction
of its business. The judges were complaining
of the cramped condition of their
rooms, and the need of further accommodations.
The question of a new court house
was publicly discussed. It was not, however,
until July 6, 1859, that anything definite was
done. The Board of Supervisors awoke to the
necessity of the hour, and decided to renew
their efforts to accomplish the desired result.
On the 18th of July, 1860, they resolved to
make a new application to the Legislature for
authority to purchase land and erect the necessary
buildings thereon.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April an act was passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
authorizing the Board of Supervisors of Kings
County to build a court house for the county.
The county treasurer was authorized by the
act, under the direction of the Board of Supervisors,
to borrow on the credit of the county
a sum not exceeding $100,000, and to give his
official bonds, in such form as the Board might
prescribe, for the payment of the same, with
interest payable annually or semi-annually as
the Board might direct. The money so collected
was to be expended, under the direction
of the Supervisors, in the purchase of lands
and the erection of a building for the proper
accommodation of the courts and county officials.
The act also provided for a levy of tax
to pay the principal and interest. The Board
of Supervisors was authorized to select and
determine the location; and when completed,
and ready for occupancy, and notice thereof
filed, by the Board with the clerk of said
county, the same should become for all purposes
the court house of the county.</p>

<p>On the 23d of May, 1860, a special committee
was appointed to select a proper site
for the building, and to report to the Board.
Every owner of lots was anxious to dispose of
them to the county. Washington Park had
its advocates. So favorably did the Supervisors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
look upon that location, that a committee
was appointed to confer with the Board
of Aldermen on the subject. When it began
to look as if a portion of that famous old hill
would be chosen, the abutting owners sent in
a remonstrance, claiming that as the park had
been paid for in part by assessment on the
surrounding property, the city had no right
to grant any such privilege. The city fathers,
adopting this view of the case, gave the Board
no satisfaction, and the scheme was abandoned.</p>

<p>A circular was prepared, and invitations
extended to architects to submit plans. The
plans were to be deposited with Albert H. Osborn,
clerk of the Board of Supervisors, on or
before June 3, 1861. A large number were
submitted, some coming from St. Louis. The
plan of King and Tackritz of Brooklyn was
finally accepted.</p>

<p>In March, 1861, the special committee appointed
by the Supervisors purchased the land
on which the present building stands for
$70,000. The land having cost $70,000, only
$30,000 was left of the sum directed to be
raised to purchase the land and erect the building.
As that was insufficient for the purpose,
the aid of the Legislature was again invoked,
and the passage of an additional act obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
authorizing the Supervisors to borrow, on the
credit of the county, an additional sum of
$100,000 to be expended under their direction
for the erection of a building or buildings, for
the use of the courts and county offices.</p>

<p>In 1858 the expense of supporting the almshouse,
and the several institutions connected
therewith, was $158,604.66. Including expenditures
for out-door relief, the aggregate cost
of supporting the poor of the county was
$192,079.77. The average number of inmates
during the year ending August 1, 1858, was
1495. The cost for the support of each of
them was $106.09, or $2.04 per week. This
was a decrease on each as compared with the
previous year.</p>

<p>The expenses of the several departments
were as follows: Almshouse, $36,530.15; hospital,
$51,755.19; lunatic asylum, $33,068.26;
nursery, $20,571.31; store, $605; miscellaneous,
not including temporary relief, $16,074.07.</p>

<p>The total number remaining July 31, 1857,
was 1274; number admitted during year,
8570; number of infants boarded out during
year, 123; number temporarily relieved, in
Brooklyn, Western District, 20,793; Eastern
District, 11,661; Flatlands, Flatbush, and New
Lots, 378; New Utrecht, 108; making a total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of 32,940; and the total number relieved and
supported wholly or in part during the year
ending July 31, 1858, was 41,623. The population
of the county was at this time about
254,000. The number relieved was 16-1/3 per
cent. of the population.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to state the number
of persons remaining in these institutions at
the termination of previous fiscal years. The
official statement is as follows: 1849, 494;
1850, 592; 1851, 662; 1852, 873; 1853, 969;
1854, 1156; 1855, 1533; 1856, 1347; 1857,
1274; 1858, 1239.</p>

<p>The number admitted to the hospital during
the year 1858 was 2299, of whom 148 were
born in the hospital.</p>

<p>During the seven years from August 1,
1850, to August 1, 1857, there were 235 cases
of small-pox, of which only 35 died. Of those
admitted into the hospital during 1857 and
1858, 565 were born in the United States,
1261 in Ireland, and 369 in Germany. On
the 31st of July, 1858, there were 268 patients
in the lunatic asylum. In 1850 the number
in the asylum was only 91. The nursery had,
in 1858, 111 boys and 103 girls; total, 214.</p>

<p>On the 31st of July, 1862, there were in the
almshouse, 373; in the nursery, 260; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
lunatic asylum, 366. In 1863 there were 404
in the almshouse; in the nursery, 217; and in
the lunatic asylum, 396.</p>

<p>The total number relieved and supported,
in whole or in part, for the year ending July
31, 1863, was 22,879. The population of the
city at the time was 295,000. The net cost
was $141,640.52.</p>

<p>Mayor Hall was succeeded by Samuel S.
Powell, who served for three terms. During
his occupancy of the Mayor's chair many significant
advances were made in the growth of
the city. In April, 1857, the Metropolitan
Police law went into effect. By this enactment
the counties of New York, Kings, Westchester,
and Richmond, and the towns of Newtown,
Flushing, and Jamaica were placed under
a single system of police. The first commissioners
from Brooklyn were J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T. Stranahan,
James W. Nye, and James Bowen.</p>

<p>Ridgewood water was supplied to the city
through mains which were opened on December
4, 1858. In April of the following year
the event was marked by a public demonstration.
The Brooklyn Academy of Music was
incorporated in 1859, and the collegiate department
of the Long Island College Hospital was
opened.</p>

<p>The sense of impending and imminent
danger, which made itself felt throughout the
country in the winter of 1860&ndash;61, was strongly
apparent in Brooklyn, and when the crash
came the city was not unprepared in any
sense.</p>

<p>It was only a few days after the election of
Martin Kalbfleisch as <span class="locked">Mayor<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> that Brooklyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was startled by the news that Fort Sumter
had surrendered.</p>

<p>The announcement occasioned intense excitement
throughout the city. In a remarkably
short space of time the strength of the
city's loyalty to the Union cause made itself
felt. Those who sympathized with the South,
or who were wavering in their allegiance,
were made to feel the necessity for modifying
their views, or for avoiding any sign of disloyalty.
The national flag appeared in every
quarter of the city. Its absence was noted
wherever that absence could be construed into
a sign of unpatriotic feeling. Crowds threatened
violence to Southern sympathizers. The
Mayor urged moderation, and the early excesses
of patriotism soon passed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, volunteers flocked to the flag.
The four militia regiments in the Fifth Brigade
were the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Twenty-eighth,
and Seventieth. At the time of the
alarm the regiments were not numerically
strong. Less than 300 men were in the Thirteenth;
less than 200 in the Fourteenth; the
Twenty-eighth and Seventieth were somewhat
stronger.</p>

<p>At the call of the President the regiments
rapidly filled. Captain W.&nbsp;H. Hogan organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
an artillery company. In the Eastern
District, the Forty-seventh Regiment was organized,
with Colonel J.&nbsp;V. Meserole in command.
Amid enthusiastic demonstrations the
Fourteenth left for the front in May, 1861.</p>

<p>The scenes during the first hours of the
war period were those characteristic of every
community in which the Union sentiment was
strong and unquestionable. Every class in
the community made response. Plymouth
Church, from whose pulpit had come the loyal
and stirring oratory of Henry Ward Beecher,
subscribed $1000 toward the equipment of
the local regiments. A sum equally generous
came from the Pierrepont Street Baptist
Church. The Union Ferry Company offered
to continue the salaries of any of its employees
who might volunteer, thus assuring
the safety of their families. Local business
men and corporations gave similar demonstrations
of patriotism. The appropriations of
the Common Council began with a provision
for the disbursement of $75,000 for the relief
of the families of those who should volunteer.
The Kings County Medical Society resolved
that its members should attend gratuitously
the families of volunteers.</p>

<p>There were signs of lukewarmness in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
quarters, and definite manifestations of
sympathy with the South; but these met with
decisive rebuke whenever they appeared. The
Navy Yard was threatened, or was supposed
to be threatened, by incendiary rebel sympathizers,
but prompt action prevented the possibility
of any form of attack.</p>

<p>A war meeting at Fort Greene drew out
50,000 people, and elicited demonstrations of
hearty patriotism. A corps of Brooklyn women
volunteered as nurses, and lint societies were
organized by energetic women who undertook
to supply equipment for the nurses. Women
in the Clinton Avenue Congregational Church
supplied over fifteen hundred yards of bandaging
to the Twenty-eighth Regiment, which,
amid great enthusiasm, followed the Thirteenth
to the front. Brooklyn was largely represented
in the organizing of the Twenty-first New
York Volunteers. The organization of the
Forty-eighth New York, under Colonel Perry,
the First Long Island Regiment, the Nineteenth
New York Volunteers (East New York),
and the Fifth Independent Battery followed.</p>

<p>In 1861 the city and county sent out 10,000
men. The draft of 1862 rather staggered the
city at its first coming, but the rally was enthusiastic,
and the patriotic work proceeded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The armories of the city became centres of
loyal activity.</p>

<p>The new fighting engine, the Monitor, was
launched at Greenpoint in January, 1862. In
March the novel iron craft had her struggle
with the rebel Merrimac in Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>Greenpoint sent over a company to the
Thirty-first New York Volunteers.</p>

<p>In 1863 the local militia, or National Guard,
included the Thirteenth Regiment, under
Colonel Woodward; the Twenty-third, Colonel
Everdell; the Twenty-eighth, Colonel
Bennett; the Forty-seventh, Colonel Meserole;
the Fifty-second, Colonel Cole; the Fifty-sixth,
Colonel Adams. In the Southern trips,
such as those made by the Twenty-third and
the Forty-seventh regiments, the National
Guard performed excellent service aside from
the heavier duty in action.</p>

<p>The New York draft riots of 1863 naturally
affected Brooklyn very closely, not only in
such instances of mob violence as the firing of
the grain elevators in the Atlantic Basin, but
in the menacing and really dangerous movements
incident to the reign of terror. Brooklyn
volunteers lent important aid in the defense
of the State Arsenal in New York.</p>

<p>To facilitate recruiting in the county, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Supervisors, in November, 1863, resolved upon
acquiring a loan of $250,000, and $300 bounty
was afterward paid to each recruit.</p>

<p>Mayor Kalbfleisch was succeeded as Mayor
in 1864 by Colonel Wood, who had organized
the Fourteenth Regiment, was wounded and
captured at the first Bull Run, and was released
by exchange in 1862.</p>

<p>The return of the "Brooklyn Phalanx," the
First Long Island Regiment, under Colonel
Cross, in January, 1864, was the occasion for
an immense demonstration. The regiment
had taken part in fourteen battles, and came
home with 234 men out of 1000.</p>

<p>An event of the war period that is to be
regarded as of the highest significance, not
only for the relation it bore to the necessities
of the war, but to the progress of the city, was
what is known as the great Sanitary fair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
  <img id="if_i122" src="images/i122.jpg" width="589" height="357" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">CRUISER BROOKLYN, BUILT IN 1858
</div></div>

<p>This Brooklyn and Long Island fair was
instituted by the War Fund Committee of
Brooklyn and Kings County, and the Woman's
Relief Association of Brooklyn, which was
known as the Brooklyn Auxiliary of the
United States Sanitary Commission. The
fair committee was organized with A.&nbsp;A. Low
as president. Arrangements for coöperation
between all the churches and private and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
public societies in the city were efficiently
perfected, and a public meeting was held at
the Academy of Music in January, 1864.
Meetings to promote the same object were
held at Flatbush, Greenpoint, and elsewhere.
Buildings were erected adjacent to the Academy
to give shelter to the Museum of Arts, a
restaurant, a department of relics and curiosities,
and quarters for the "Drum Beat," a
journal published during the fair, under the
editorship of the Rev. Dr. Storrs and Francis
Williams.</p>

<p>The fair opened on Washington's Birthday
with a great military parade. The Academy
presented a brilliant spectacle. The art display
in the Assembly rooms was a triumph in
the art annals of the city; the New England
Kitchen ingeniously duplicated the features
of a colonial New England domestic scene.</p>

<p>On March 11 the fair closed with a memorable
calico ball. In the hall of manufactures
was a huge broom, sent from Cincinnati,
and bearing this inscription: "Sent by the
managers of the Cincinnati Fair, Greeting:
We have swept up $240,000; Brooklyn,
beat this if you can." Brooklyn's reply, in
the words of an individual respondent,
was: "Brooklyn sees the $240,000, and goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
$150,000 better." Such, indeed, were the
superb figures of profit from this remarkable
enterprise.</p>

<p>The fair has been much extolled for its influence
on the city itself. "The first great
act of self-assertion ever made by the city of
Brooklyn," is a typical comment on the event.
However the fair may be regarded in this
light, it was a brilliantly successful effort. The
service of the Women's Relief Association, of
which Mrs. J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T. Stranahan was the distinguished
leader, was in the highest degree
admirable.</p>

<p>The Christian Commission for Brooklyn
and Long Island, to act in concert with the
United States Christian Commission, was organized
in March. Before the close of the
war this commission had sent out 1210 Bibles
and parts of the Scriptures; 4033 psalm books
and hymn books; 50,544 magazines and pamphlets;
177,520 newspapers and periodicals,
and other printing, making up a total of
1,078,304.</p>

<p>The Supervisors of the county repeatedly
took measures to stimulate volunteers. In
July (1864) the Board directed its bounty
committee "to pay to any person furnishing
an accepted volunteer or recruit for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
years' United States service, the sum not exceeding
$300, the same as paid to any drafted
man furnishing a substitute, and to be paid
upon the like certificate of the United States
officer, and without regard to the person furnishing
such recruit being liable to be drafted
into the United States service."</p>

<p>In July, shortly after the laying of the corner-stone
of an armory in the Eastern District,
the committee began paying "hand-money"
prizes of $175 and upward to persons bringing
recruits. In September the news that
Kings County was "out of the draft" was
hailed with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Early in 1865 the evidences that the war
was drawing to a close clearly appeared. A
party of excursionists which left Brooklyn, in
April, on the steamer Oceanus, learned at
Charleston of Lee's surrender, and witnessed
the restoration of the flag on Sumter. The
Rev. Dr. Storrs and Henry Ward Beecher
were present and spoke. The party heard of
Lincoln's assassination before reaching home.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Ford's Theatre, by which
the strong hand of Lincoln was taken from
the government of the nation, threw the city
into profound gloom. The War Fund Committee
opened subscriptions, which were limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to one dollar from each person, and the
result of this prompt, patriotic, and well-managed
movement was the statue of Lincoln by
Henry K. Brown, which occupies a commanding
place in Prospect Park <span class="locked">Plaza.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The record of Brooklyn's National Guard
organizations is an honorable one. The Thirteenth
Regiment (National Guard), the first
company of which, known as the Brooklyn
Light Guard, was organized as long ago as
1827, had for its first colonel Abel Smith.
The call of President Lincoln in 1861 elicited
a unanimous offer of service from the Thirteenth,
which went farther south than any
other New York regiment, save the Eleventh.
It formed a part of the left wing of McClellan's
army. When the regiment was called into
active service for the third time, John B.
Woodward was in <span class="locked">command.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>The Fourteenth Regiment has the distinction
of being the only one of the National
Guard regiments that served throughout the
war. It left for the front under command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Colonel Alfred M. Wood. At Bull Run, at
Gettysburg, in the Wilderness, and elsewhere,
it performed heavy and prolonged service. In
twenty-one battles its mettle was tested, and
the record made by the "red-legged devils"
is a brilliant and honorable one.</p>

<p>The Twenty-third Regiment was the outgrowth
of one of the Home Guard companies
of the war period. It was summoned to Harrisburgh,
Penn., in 1863, being then in command
of Colonel Everdell. The subsequent
history of the regiment has been one of steady
rise in efficiency and distinction.</p>

<p>The Forty-seventh Regiment, organized, as
already stated, under the leadership of J.&nbsp;V.
<span class="locked">Meserole,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> was called to Washington, and was
recalled after thirty days' service in consequence
of the draft riots, in which, with the
Forty-third, it performed valuable service.</p>

<p>The Third Battery was organized in 1864,
by Major E.&nbsp;O. Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>Brooklyn is estimated to have contributed
30,000 men to the guards and armies of the
Union during the war; but this estimate
would not represent the highly creditable extent
of the city's support to the great cause
which saw its triumph in 1865.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
During the years of the war the voice of the
Brooklyn press gave no uncertain sound. The
"Eagle" had become a lusty leader of public
opinion. The "Times" on the other side of
the city was making for itself a creditable
name. The "Daily Union," established in
1863, voiced the ardor of the Union cause
with energetic patriotism. German readers
found in the "Long Island <span class="locked">Anzeiger,"<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> started
in 1864, cordial support to every good Northern
principle in a strain worthy of the young
journal's editor, Colonel Henry E. Roehr, who
had been one of the earliest volunteers, and
won many honors at the front. In 1872 Colonel
Roehr began the publication of a German
daily paper, the "Freie Presse."</p>

<p>On the 7th of April, 1863, the Legislature
passed another act authorizing the Supervisors
to raise a sum not exceeding $125,000, to be
used in the erection and furnishing of the
Court House building.</p>

<p>The ground on which the Court House
stands is 140 feet on Fulton and Joralemon
streets, by 351 feet deep. No better location<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
could have been selected. The building was
constructed under the direction of the Board
of Supervisors, of which body the late General
Crook was chairman. The building committee
were Samuel Booth, Charles C. Talbot,
William H. Hazzard, Charles A. Carnaville,
Gilliam Schenck, and George G. Herman.
The architects were Gamaliel King and Henry
Teckritz.</p>

<p>The ground was broken October, 1861, and
the corner-stone was laid May 20, 1862, by
the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons
of New York, Daniel T. Walden of
Brooklyn officiating as Grand Master. Addresses
were made on the occasion by Mayor
Kalbfleisch, representing the city; General
Crook, president of the Board of Supervisors,
representing the county; Judge John A. Lott,
for the judiciary; and Dr. Storrs delivered an
eloquent address.</p>

<p>Owing to the unsettled condition of the
country, during the Rebellion, the work did
not advance rapidly. The price of materials
increased, and labor commanded war prices.
Many of the contractors declined to proceed,
and new and less advantageous contracts had
to be made. The price of the carpenters'
work alone was increased $5000, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
feverish state of the times added more than
$100,000 to the expense. The total cost of the
building, land, and furniture was $551,757.28.</p>

<p>The building is erected on the site of the
old Military Garden. When the land was
purchased and the building erected, there were
some old buildings between it and Boerum
Place. The Court House was placed on a
line with the street, in order that it might not
be hidden by the adjoining structures. It is a
great pity that the Supervisors did not see
that in the process of time the adjoining land
would be owned by the county. Had they
thought of this, they could have placed the
edifice twenty feet further back from the street,
and thereby greatly improved its appearance.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the Court House was
constructed within the sum appropriated. Its
manner of construction is in striking contrast
to the methods pursued in New York. It
stands to-day a monument to the integrity and
capacity of the Board of Supervisors, and all
in any wise concerned in its construction.</p>

<p>The building was finished in February,
1865, and thrown open to public inspection
on the evenings of February 28 and March 1,

<p>When Samuel Booth entered the office of
Mayor in 1866, the city of Brooklyn, in common
with other communities throughout the
country, was suffering from the results of the
strain imposed by the war and its resulting
incidents; and the fact that his own party was
in the minority in the Board of Aldermen did
not lighten the burden of the Mayor. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
these political conditions no veto
by Booth was overridden by the Board.</p>

<p>In February of this year the Legislature
created a metropolitan sanitary district corresponding
to the metropolitan police district,
and a board of health composed of the police
commissioners, four sanitary commissioners,
and the health officer of the port of New
York. Brooklyn was represented in this board
by Dr. James Crane, as sanitary commissioner,
and T.&nbsp;G. Bergen as police commissioner.
Dr. John T. Conkling was made assistant
sanitary superintendent, and Dr. R. Cresson
Stiles was made deputy registrar of vital statistics
for Brooklyn. To this force six sanitary
inspectors were added.</p>

<p>This movement represented the practical
beginnings of that interesting modern system
of sanitary inspection and regulation by which
the cities of New York and Brooklyn have in
recent years attained such improved conditions.
The movement had been urged by the
prevalence of cholera in Europe, and the new
board found occasion to make great exertions
to prevent the entrance of the disease here.
The disease appeared in New York in April,
and Brooklyn's first case was reported on July
8. In spite of the precautions the disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gained considerable headway in sections of the
city where the sanitary conditions were worst,
and the total number of cases in Brooklyn
reached 816. More than a quarter of the total
number of cases occurred in the twelfth ward.
The number of deaths in the city reached
573. The cholera hospital, opened at Hamilton
Avenue and Van Brunt Street in July,
was closed on October 1.</p>

<p>In October the completion of the large Erie
Basin dry docks was the occasion of a celebration.
These great docks, built by a Boston
syndicate, have since been used by most of the
large iron ships that are docked at the port of
New York. The chamber of Dock No. 1 is
510 feet long, and 112 feet wide at the top.
Dock No. 2 is 610 feet long and 124 feet wide
at the top.</p>

<p>In this month occurred also the interesting
occasion marked by the presentation of the
medals ordered by the Common Council for
each honorably discharged, or still serving,
Brooklyn soldier who had done his share toward
the saving of the Union.</p>

<p>Among the legacies of the war was a great
deal of poverty that public provision had not
obliterated. An exceptional degree of distress
appeared during the decade following the war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
There were admitted into the almshouse
during the year ending July 31, 1868, 5500
persons, and at the close of the year there
remained 1995. The total number relieved by
the commissioners during the year was 44,734.
The amount expended was $464,800.61, being
an average of $10.40 to each person relieved.
Of the number relieved, 7273 were in the
institutions. The population of the county
at this time was 375,000. It will be seen that
11.9 per cent, of the population received aid
from the public institutions. In addition to
this, many others received assistance from the
churches and benevolent societies.</p>

<p>Formerly the county was divided into districts,
to which the poor would come to receive
assistance. During the year ending July 31,
1870, 38,270 persons applied for and received
aid. This was about ten per cent, of the population.
The amount expended was $128,602.83.</p>

<p>This system has been discontinued, and the
work is done by other agencies, notably by the
Society for Improving the Condition of the
Poor. This society, officered by public-spirited
and efficient men, has made a highly creditable
record. Connected with the society is an
effective advisory committee, selected from
each ward. Every case is carefully investigated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and imposition is rendered almost impossible.
In 1880 the number of cases investigated
was 2755; of these 214, or about eight
per cent., were rejected. The number relieved
who were found worthy was about one fourteenth
of the number receiving aid in 1870,
while the disbursements were only $23,009.68,
or 18.5 per cent. of the former expense.</p>

<p>During the year ending July 31, 1869, there
were remaining in the lunatic asylum of the
county, 557. The whole number under treatment
during the year was 818. Of those remaining,
225 were males and 322 females.
There were admitted, during the year, 286.
The whole number admitted into the almshouse
in 1869 was 2090.</p>

<p>The number treated in the hospital in 1863
was 2023; in 1864, 2601; in 1866, 3505; in
1867, 2828; in 1868, 2613. In the hospital
there were treated, in 1876, 4270 persons.</p>

<p>By an act of the Legislature in May, 1867,
the Inebriates' Home for Kings County was
incorporated. A movement led by A.&nbsp;E.
Mudie resulted in the establishment of a
Brooklyn branch of the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

<p>The Legislature provided at this session for
the dredging and docking of Gowanus Canal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and for the "Wallabout Improvement," under
the direction of a commissioner. Another
provision of the Legislature was for a department
for the survey and inspection of buildings
in the Western District of the city.
A section of this law provided that the chief
officer of this department should be called the
"Superintendent of Buildings." He was to
be appointed by the board of trustees of the
fire department, and confirmed by the Board
of Aldermen. He was to have been an "exempt
fireman" for five years, a fire underwriter
for ten years, and was to be, ex officio, a
member of the board of trustees of the fire
department.</p>

<p>Concerning the duties of inspectors the law
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It shall be the duty of the inspectors to
examine all buildings whereon violations are
reported, and all buildings reported dangerous
or damaged by fire, and make a written report
of such examinations to the superintendent,
with their opinion relative thereto; to reëxamine
all buildings under applications to raise,
enlarge, alter, or build upon, and report to the
superintendent the condition of the same,
with their opinion relative thereto; and in the
absence of the superintendent they shall be
empowered to act with all the powers enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and possessed by said superintendent. And
the said inspectors shall perform such other
duties as the superintendent of buildings may
from time to time require of them.</p>

<p>"The inspectors of buildings shall be under
the direction of the superintendent, and shall
attend all fires occurring in their respective
districts, and report to the chief engineer or
assistant engineer present, all information they
may have relative to the construction and
condition of the buildings or premises on fire,
and the adjoining buildings, whether the same
be dangerous or otherwise, and report in
writing to said department, all such buildings
damaged by fire or otherwise, with a statement
of the nature and amount of such damages,
as near as they can ascertain, together
with the street and number of such building,
the name of the owners, lessees, and occupants,
and for what purpose occupied; and said inspectors
shall examine all buildings in course
of erection, alteration, and repair throughout
their respective districts, at least once every
day (Sundays and holidays excepted), and shall
report in writing, forthwith, to the superintendent,
all violations of any of the several
divisions of this act, together with the street
and number of the building or premises upon
which violations are found, and the names of
the owners, agents, lessees, occupants, builders,
masons, carpenters, roofers, furnace builders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and architects, and all other matters relative
thereto, and shall report in the same manner
all new buildings in their respective districts,
and the clerk shall perform such duties as may be
assigned him by the superintendent. All
the officers appointed under this act shall, so
far as may be necessary for the performance
of their respective duties, have the right to
enter any building or premises in said city."</p></blockquote>

<p>The fire limits of the city were then fixed
to "comprise all that portion of said city beginning
at the East River at the northwest corner
of the United States Navy Yard, and running
thence southwesterly and southeasterly along
said Navy Yard to the centre of Navy Street;
thence southerly along the centre of Navy

King Street, and one hundred feet southerly
therefrom, to the East River, and thence along
the easterly shore of the East River to the
point or place of beginning at the said northwest
corner of the United States Navy Yard;
and also extending from the centre of Washington
Avenue along both sides of Fulton
Avenue, one hundred feet on each side, to the
easterly side of Bedford Avenue, and such
further portion of the Western District of said
city as the Common Council of the city of
Brooklyn by ordinance may from time to time,
as hereinafter provided, include therein."</p>

<p>The act provided in detail rules for building
within the fire limits, and regulations
appertaining to building in general. Thus
it was provided that "no timber shall be
used in the front or rear walls of any dwelling,
store, or storehouse, or other building hereafter
built or erected within the Western District
of said city, where stone, brick, or iron
is commonly used; each lintel on the inside
of the front or rear wall or side walls shall
have a secure brick arch over it, and no wall
strips in any wall thereof shall exceed in thickness
one half of one inch, and in width two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and one half inches; and no bond timber in
any wall thereof shall in width and thickness
exceed the width and thickness of a course of
brick; and no bond timber shall be more than
six feet in length; and such bond timbers shall
be laid at least eighteen inches apart from
each other, longitudinally, on either side of
any wall, and the continuous line thereof shall
be broken every six feet by inserting a brick
of eight inches; and no front, rear, or other
wall of any such dwelling, store, storehouse, or
other building now erected, or hereafter to be
erected, as aforesaid, within the fire limits, or
as they may hereafter be extended as aforesaid,
or any brick or stone building or buildings
in the Western District of the city of
Brooklyn, shall be cut off or altered below, to
be supported in any manner, in whole or in
part, by wood, but shall be wholly supported
by brick, stone, or iron; and no wood or timber
shall be used between such wall and such
supporters; but it shall be lawful to insert a
lintel of wood over the doors and windows of
the first story of stores, of oak or Georgia pine,
of such length and size as shall be first approved
and determined by the superintendent
of buildings."</p>

<p>An important movement, begun before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
war, culminating in 1860, and bearing fruit
soon after the close of the war, resulted in the
establishment of one of Brooklyn's chief objects
of pride,&mdash;Prospect Park. The actual
construction of the park began in 1866, and
was steadily continued until 1874.</p>

<p>The laying out and adornment of the park
was placed in the hands of a commission, of
which J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T. Stranahan, always a leading
figure in the park movement, was the president.
This commission, originally constituted
under an act of the Legislature for the laying
out, adornment, and management of the park,
had its powers and duties increased by succeeding
laws, until it had under its control
Washington Park, City Park, Carroll Park,
the Parade Ground, and all the public grounds
appertaining to the city.</p>

<p>In their report for 1868 the commissioners
said: "The propriety, if not the absolute necessity,
of an extension of Prospect Park at its
western angle, so as to allow the principal
drive in that direction to be carried out according
to the original design, has been repeatedly
urged in former reports of the board, and the
Legislature was on more than one occasion
applied to for permission to make the desired
acquisition; but without success. The commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
have now, however, the pleasure of
stating that an act was passed at the last session,
authorizing this extension, and directing
the board to apply to the Supreme Court for
the appointment of commissioners to estimate
the value of the land so taken."</p>

<p>The ground under treatment during the
year covered by this report represented over
two hundred acres. "The finished drives,"
says this report, "now amount to nearly three
miles and a quarter, being a little more than
two miles in excess of that which we were able
to report last year. Of bridle paths, we have
nearly a mile and a half finished or well progressed;
and of walks three miles and three
quarters are completed, and nearly five additional
miles in progress. The very large and
continually increasing number of delighted
visitors show how thoroughly these walks and
drives are appreciated by them. A fine specimen
of rustic work has been erected near the
main entrance to the park for a summer
house; and a vine-covered trellis-work, with
seats overlooking the children's play-ground,
commands a beautiful sea and island view,
and, when covered with the foliage and flowers
of climbing plants, will afford grateful shelter
to all such as may be disposed to linger in its
shade."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The arrangement of the park steadily advanced
until it has become one of the most
beautiful in the world. Covering 525 acres,
its meadows, woodland, lakes, and drives combine
to create a picture of remarkable beauty.
The lakes cover 50 acres; the woodland, 110
acres; the meadows, 70 acres; the gardens
and shrubbery, 200 acres; and there are over
60 acres of water-way. Five and a half miles
of main drives were laid out, and minor drives
and walks covering a distance of thirteen miles.</p>

<p>The later creation of the Ocean Parkway
was a desirable movement, resulting as it did
in a driveway running southward from the
park to the sea,&mdash;a distance of five and a half
miles. This magnificent drive is 210 feet wide
for its entire length, being subdivided into a
main and two minor roadways, with lines of
shade-trees to mark the receding lines.</p>

<p>The Parade Ground, adjoining the park on
the east, was a popular device. The broad
field has contributed an important factor in
the summer life of the city, its acres being in
constant demand during the out-door season
for all manner of sports.</p>

<p>These improvements and others associated
with the minor parks of the city have placed
heavy obligations on the park commissioners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
A permanent board of water and sewerage
commissioners was created by an act of April
2, 1869. The board received exclusive power
to cause streets to be repaved, regraded, and
repaired; to cause cross-walks to be relaid and
sidewalks to be reflagged; and generally to
have such other improvements, in and about
such streets so to be repaved, regraded, or repaired,
to be made, as in their judgment the
public wants and convenience shall require.
The board held other authority, afterward
vested in the board of city works.</p>

<p>The charter of the Nassau Water Company
was obtained in 1855. In 1857 the city had
acquired all the contracts, property, and rights
of the Nassau Company. The thirty-six inch
main laid from Ridgewood in 1858 was followed
by an additional forty-eight inch main
laid in 1867. Three mains have since been
added, giving the city water from a drainage
area of seventy-four square miles.</p>

<p>The act of 1869, by which the fire department
of the city was reorganized, called upon
the Mayor, the street commissioners, the
president of the Board of Aldermen, the city
treasurer, and the comptroller, to appoint four
citizens as fire commissioners: "Said commissioners,
on being qualified, shall meet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
reorganize the fire department of the city of
Brooklyn, by electing one of said commissioners
to be president, and appointing a person
to be secretary; whereupon they shall possess
and have all the power and authority conferred
upon or possessed by any and all officers of
the present fire departments of the city of
Brooklyn, and of each division thereof, except
such power and authority as is now vested by
law in the trustees of the fire departments
of the Eastern and Western districts of the
city of Brooklyn, which said divisions shall
continue distinct from each other, so far as
relates to the Widows' and Orphans' Fund of
each district, but for no other purpose; and
the persons elected and now acting as the
trustees of the Widows' and Orphans' Fund
of the Eastern District, and those elected
and acting as trustees of the Widows' and
Orphans' Fund of the Western District, shall
remain and continue to have and exercise,
each division respectively, all such powers and
duties as are now vested by law in said boards,
with regard to the Widows' and Orphans'
Fund of each district" (sec. 2).</p>

<p>By the report of School Superintendent
Buckley, issued in July (1869), it appeared that
the whole number of pupils attending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
public day schools numbered 70,000. In the
evening schools 10,000 more were taught,
while the private schools received 22,142 scholars.
At this time the value of the schoolhouse
sites in the city was placed at $276,386; that
of the buildings at $709,727.</p>

<p>Building throughout the city became very
active. The widening of Broadway in the
Eastern District materially affected the prosperity
of that section of the city, to which
Broadway became the leading business artery.
Grand Street developed into a busy thoroughfare,
and Fourth Street, now northern Bedford
Avenue, became the third important street of
this section. For a site for a new building on
Broadway at Fifth (now Driggs Street), the
Williamsburgh Savings Bank paid the then
enormous sum of $210,000. The superb structure
afterward erected on this ground is one
of the most imposing in the city, its classic
dome rearing itself among those objects in
the city which command first attention from
Bridge spectators.</p>

<p>In 1869 it was estimated that Brooklyn had
500 miles of streets, and 150 miles of sewer.
Mayor Kalbfleisch's message reported a total
of 3307 buildings erected in 1868. The assessed
value of real and personal property in
the county was $199,840,551.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
But most momentous of the movements of
this period was that looking to the building of
the first East River bridge. The possibility
of a bridge over the East River had been discussed
early in the history of the two cities.
General <span class="locked">Johnson<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> had discussed the feasibility
of the suggestion, and had argued that the
plan was quite within the possibilities of engineering
science. Thomas Pope, in a volume
published in 1811, by Alexander Niven, 120
Duane Street, New York, describes his idea
of a "flying pendent lever bridge," which was
intensely original as well as impossible.</p>

<p>In 1836 General Swift proposed the erection
of a dike over the river. The dike was
to have a central drawbridge, and was to give
foundation to a broad boulevard, running between
the two cities. At a later day Colonel
Julius A. Adams of Brooklyn, while engaged
upon the bridge of the Lexington and Danville
Railroad, over the Kentucky River, conceived
the idea of an East River bridge, to
extend from Fulton Ferry on the Brooklyn
side to a point near Chatham Square, on the
New York side. The intention was to have
the main body of the bridge built of two elliptic
tubes, placed side by side, and supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ribbons of steel. There were to be three platforms
for travelers, and it is claimed by its
projector that the capacity would have been
greater than that of the present structure.
Colonel Adams communicated his plan to Mr.
William C. Kingsley, who was largely engaged
in the contracting business in this city. Mr.
Kingsley entered heartily into the spirit of the
enterprise, and carefully examined the diagrams
submitted by the engineer. He spent
several months in a thorough and exhaustive
examination of the entire question, studied the
needs of the two cities, and finally became
thoroughly impressed with the practicability
and feasibility of the scheme. In connection
with the project he consulted with some of
the eminent and public-spirited citizens of
Brooklyn, among them James S.&nbsp;T. Stranahan,
Henry C. Murphy, Judge Alexander McCue,
Isaac Van Anden, Seymour L. Husted, and
Thomas <span class="locked">Kinsella.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The more these gentlemen
talked and thought about the matter, the
deeper interest they felt in it. Mr. Kingsley
in particular continued undisturbed in the
belief that the time for bridging the river
had come, and he persisted in this view until
the enterprise was carried beyond the region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of remote speculation into the clear atmosphere
of intelligently directed and practical effort.
The Hon. Henry C. Murphy at the time represented
Kings County in the state Senate,
where he wielded a vast influence, and was regarded
as one of the leaders of his party in
the State. Upon the basis of Colonel Adams's
plans a bill was prepared providing for
the construction of a bridge across the East
River. Copies of the original drawings were
taken to Albany and exhibited in the Senate
and Assembly Chamber. The project received
Senator Murphy's unflagging support,
and through his endeavors and the energetic
and untiring aid of its projectors, it became
a law.</p>

<p>The act incorporating the New York Bridge
Company was passed by the Legislature on
April 16, 1867. It named as incorporators
the following citizens of New York and <span class="locked">Brooklyn:&mdash;</span></p>

for the site of the bridge and approaches;
to borrow money up to the limit of the capital,
and to establish laws and ordinances for the
government of the structure upon its completion.
The capital stock was fixed at $5,000,000,
in shares of $100 each, and the directors
were given power to increase the capital with
the consent of the stockholders. It was
further provided that the incorporators already
named should constitute the first board of
directors, holding their places until June 1,
1868, and that after that the board should
have not less than thirteen nor more than
twenty-one members. The officers were to
consist of a president, secretary, and treasurer.
The cities of New York and Brooklyn, or
either of them, were empowered at any time
to take the bridge by payment to the corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of the cost and 33.33 per cent. additional,
provided the bridge be made free. An additional
provision was made that the structure
should have an elevation of at least 130 feet
above high tide in the middle of the river, and
that it should in no respect prove an obstruction
to navigation. In conclusion, the law
authorized the cities of New York and Brooklyn,
or either of them, to subscribe to the capital
stock of said company such amounts as
two thirds of their Common Councils respectively
should determine, to issue bonds in payment
of these subscriptions, and to provide for
the payment of interest. It was subsequently
determined that the city of New York might
subscribe $1,500,000 of the total capital; the
city of Brooklyn, $3,000,000, and $500,000 to
be paid by the private stockholders.</p>

<p>An enterprise of such magnitude was not
carried forward without extraordinary struggles.
To keep the work, so far as possible, out
of politics required much ingenuity and persistence
on the part of those who were actuated
by the most public-spirited motives. It
was not possible to wholly eliminate politics
and self-seeking. An act of the Legislature in
1859 provided that New York city should be
represented by its Mayor, comptroller, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
president of the Board of Aldermen, and
Brooklyn by the commissioners of the sinking
fund. The company was authorized to
occupy land under water on each shore to the
distance of 250 feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, operations were begun in the
direction of an effort to raise the required
$5,000,000 by private subscription, but they
were not successful, and it was determined to
apply to the cities for aid. Application was
made to Brooklyn, through the Common
Council, for $3,000,000. After many months
the incorporators were successful, and later, in
1868, the city of New York subscribed the
$1,500,000 required, and the stockholders made
up the additional $500,000.</p>

<p>The shares, as has been shown, were fixed
at $100 each. The list of the original subscribers,
as revealed by the original minute-book
still in the possession of the trustees, is
very interesting. It is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>After the subscriptions were all made, several
of the subscribers withdrew or failed to
make good their promises, whereupon Mr.
Kingsley took up their stock and advanced
the amount necessary to cover their deficiencies.
In fact, he and the firm he represented
took in all over $300,000 of the entire $500,000
subscribed by the New York Bridge Company.</p>

<p>John A. Roebling, who had made a brilliant
record as a bridge engineer, was chosen for
the responsible post of chief engineer. His
son, Colonel Washington A. Roebling, was
made first assistant engineer. The plans of
Roebling having been duly approved by
the War Department engineers, the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
States government <span class="locked">commission,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> the Secretary
of War, and lastly of Congress itself, the
company was formally organized in the summer
of 1869, with the following directors:
Henry C. Murphy, J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T. Stranahan, Henry
W. Slocum, John W. Lewis, Seymour L.
Husted, Demas Barnes, Hugh Smith, William
Hunter, Jr., Isaac Van Anden, J.&nbsp;H. Prentice,
Alexander McCue, William M. Tweed, Peter
B. Sweeny, R.&nbsp;B. Connolly, Grenville T.
Jenks.</p>

<p>At this juncture a distressing accident
darkened the opening days of the great work.
"One morning in June, 1869, Mr. Roebling,
in company with Colonel Paine and his other
engineering associates, was engaged in running
a line across the East River, making the
first survey of the site for the Brooklyn foundation.
Colonel Paine crossed to the New
York side and made the necessary signals,
while the chief engineer stood on the Brooklyn
side. Just as the operations were approaching
completion Mr. Roebling was
standing on the rack of one of the ferry slips
taking a final observation. At the moment a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
ferryboat entered the slip and bumped heavily
against the timbers, pressing them back to the
point where the chief engineer was standing.
His foot was caught between the piling and
the rack. Colonel Paine, who was on the
boat, noticed that his chief started suddenly,
and, while he made no outcry, an expression
of agony overspread his countenance. The
first person to reach the side of the injured
man was his son, Colonel Washington A.
Roebling, and Colonel Paine quickly followed
him. The chief engineer was assisted to a
carriage, remarking, as he went, 'Oh, what
a folly.' He was quickly driven to his residence
on the Heights, and a surgeon was
summoned. The surgeon found that the toes
of the right foot were terribly crushed. It
was at once decided that amputation was
necessary. Mr. Roebling rejected the suggestion
of an anæsthetic, and personally directed
the operations of the surgeon. Nearly all of
his toes were taken off at the joints, but he
maintained his composure throughout, and
endeavored to soothe the apprehensions of his
family and friends. During his subsequent
illness he preserved intact the use of his mental
faculties, exhibiting indomitable will power.
Eight days elapsed before fears were entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of a fatal result. Then the patient
complained of a chill, and it was soon discovered
that lockjaw had set in. He lived eight
days longer, and toward the close suffered the
most excruciating agonies, but without complaint,
and steadily insisted upon directing the
method of his treatment. Even after the
muscular contraction precluded the possibility
of utterance he wrote with a pencil directions
for his attendants. He died of lockjaw just
sixteen days after receiving his injuries."</p>

<p>For a time work on the bridge was paralyzed.
As soon as possible the directors chose
Colonel Roebling to succeed his father, and
the great undertaking proceeded.</p>

<p>The mechanical difficulties of the work
were enormous. The history of the labors, by
which one difficulty after another was overcome,
is one of the most absorbing in the annals
of engineering enterprise. Huge wooden
caissons were sunken on the diving-bell principle
to a depth sufficient to assure firm foundations
for the piers, which were built over
them. The Brooklyn caisson was launched
on March 19, 1870; the New York caisson, in
September, 1871. The greater difficulties
existed on the New York side, where an area
of quicksand made it problematical whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
bed-rock could ever be reached. The foundation
on the New York side was required to be
begun at a depth of seventy-eight feet. On
the Brooklyn side brick was used under the
caisson. On the New York side the space
remaining after the lowest point had been
reached was filled with concrete.</p>

<p>The most perplexing problem having been
solved by the sinking of the foundations, the
work advanced steadily. Difficulties with
anchorages, materials, contracts, expenditures,
and appropriations made the work necessarily
slow, and there was a proportionate degree of
public impatience. The distant possibility of
a completed bridge was the permanent theme
of newspaper jest and popular song. But
the Brooklyn tower, containing 38,214 yards
of masonry, and rising 278 feet above high
water, was completed in the spring of 1875,
and by the summer of 1876 the New York
tower had also been finished.</p>

<p>During this period the pressure on the
various city ferries was demonstrating the
necessity for some relief to the strain of travel
between the two cities. During the year 1869
the Union Ferry Company carried 42,720,000
passengers; the Roosevelt, Grand, and James
Slip ferries, 7,028,000 passengers; the Greenpoint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
1,622,250; and the Thirty-fourth Street,
2,250,550. The terms of the new lease of the
Union Ferry Company included a provision
that the fare between five and half-past seven
o'clock, morning and evening, be one cent.
It was a few months later that the Brooklyn
City Railroad Company reduced its rate of
fare to five cents.</p>

<p>Mayor Kalbfleisch was reëlected Mayor.
In his message of January 3, 1871, he places
the population of the city in 1870 at 400,000;
the taxes levied during the year at $8,000,000;
the city debt at $36,000,000. The period was
active in building operations. The foundations
of the still unfinished Roman Catholic Cathedral
were laid in 1868. The Twenty-eighth
Regiment armory was completed in 1870.
The Brooklyn Theatre was begun early in the
following year, shortly before the finishing of
the new wing of the Long Island College
Hospital, and the laying of the corner-stone
of the Church Charity foundation at Albany
Avenue and Herkimer Street.</p>

<p>Brooklyn acquired a police department distinct
from that of New York in 1870. The
management and control of this new department
was vested in a board of commissioners,
known as the Board of Police of the City of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Brooklyn, composed of the Mayor and two
other persons nominated by him, and appointed
by the Aldermen. The first two commissioners
thus chosen were Daniel D. Driggs and Isaac
Van Anden. Patrick Campbell was appointed
chief clerk. Henry W. Van Wagner was
placed at the head of the detective squad.
The following provisions were embraced in
the law establishing the department. "The
commissioners shall divide said city into precincts,
not exceeding one precinct to each
thirty-six of the patrolmen authorized to be
appointed. They may also establish sub-precincts
and assign two sergeants, two doormen,
and as many patrolmen as they may deem
sufficient to each sub-precinct, and shall appoint
a telegraph operator who shall be assigned to
duty by the chief of police. They shall appoint
as many captains of police as there may
be precincts, and assign one captain and as
many sergeants and patrolmen as they shall
deem sufficient to each precinct. The police
force shall consist of a chief of police, captains,
sergeants, and patrolmen, who shall be appointed
by the commissioners. The number
of sergeants shall not exceed four for each
precinct, and one for each special squad; and
the number of patrolmen shall not exceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the present number now doing duty in said
city, unless the Common Council of the city
of Brooklyn shall, by resolution, authorize a
greater number, in which case they shall not
exceed the number fixed in such resolutions;
and such resolutions may be passed by the
Common Council from time to time as that
body may deem expedient. The commissioners
shall fill all vacancies in the police
force as often as they occur."</p>

<p>By the message of Mayor <span class="locked">Powell<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> in January,
1872, it appears that there were 450 men
on the police force, supported at an annual
expense of $500,000. The total liabilities of
the city were then over $30,000,000, and the
total county debt nearly $4,000,000. During
1871 twenty miles of streets were graded
and paved, and 2,596 buildings erected. In
his second message, a year later, the Mayor
reported that the water department was self-sustaining.</p>

<p>The pressure of opinion in favor of a new
charter for the city resulted in the appointment
of a committee of one hundred, whose
report appeared in 1872, shortly before the
death of ex-Mayor Kalbfleisch. In May the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
charter was passed by the State Assembly.
By this charter the offices of Mayor, auditor,
and comptroller were made elective; the excise
and police departments were consolidated;
the appointment of heads of departments was
placed in the hands of the Mayor and Aldermen,
the departments being as follows: Police
and excise, finance, audit, treasury, collections,
arrears, law, assessment, health, fire and buildings,
city works, parks, public instruction.</p>

<p>In November, 1873, John W. Hunter, who
had represented the third district in Congress,
was chosen Mayor. The Mayor's message in
the following January shows that the city debt
rose from $30,669,768.50 in 1872, and $32,012,884
in 1873, to $37,431,944.</p>

<p>It was in February of this year that a largely
attended meeting of the Municipal Union
Society urged the consolidation of Brooklyn
and New York. Meanwhile the town of New
Lots, known as East New York, had voted for
annexation to Brooklyn. The city's growth
continued at a remarkable rate. In the decade
between 1864 and 1874, 19,660 buildings had
been erected. Of this number 1786 had been
built during the year ending 1874.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most sensational incident of the
year 1874 was the announcement of Theodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Tilton's action against the Rev. Henry Ward
Beecher, Brooklyn's foremost preacher and
orator. The news that the pastor of Plymouth
Church was to be sued by his former friend
upon charges assailing the integrity of Mr.
Beecher's relations with Mrs. Tilton, created
intense excitement in the city, and throughout
the country.</p>

<p>The action was opened in the City Court
before Judge Neilson, and the trial began on
January 5, 1875. The public interest aroused
by this extraordinary trial has no parallel in
the history of the county. During the months
of the progress it remained the chief topic of
public and private talk in the city. The court
room on trial days presented an historic spectacle,
and excitement reached a great height
when, at the end of June, the case was at last
closed, and the fate of the great preacher was
placed in the jury's hands. It was on July 2
that the jury reported its inability to agree.
The case was never retried, and the painful
drama thus came to an end.</p>

<p>That such an incident should cast a cloud
over Henry Ward Beecher's life was inevitable.
But the cloud passed away. Mr. Beecher
remained at his post, his fame and influence
growing; and the celebration of his seventy-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>fifth
birthday drew to the Academy of Music
one of the most remarkable gatherings ever
witnessed in that place. Mr. Beecher's sister,
Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of "Uncle
Tom's Cabin," occupied a seat in one of the
<span class="locked">boxes.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>In 1875 the population of the city was estimated
at 483,252; that of the county at 494,570.
In November of this year Frederick A.
Schroeder was elected Mayor. Schroeder represented
the staunch German element, which
had begun long before this period to form an
important proportion of the city's population.
He was the founder of the Germania Savings
Bank. In 1871 he was elected comptroller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
His opponent in a heated mayoralty contest
was Edward Rowe.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary incident of the year
1876 was the burning of the Brooklyn Theatre
in December, and the loss of 295 lives. This
tragedy caused intense excitement throughout
the city. The temporary morgue on Adams
Street presented the most ghastly spectacle
the city had ever witnessed. After all possible
identification had taken place, 100 unclaimed
bodies were publicly buried at Greenwood.</p>

<p>Brooklyn had now fairly entered upon
what may be called its modern period. The
first wires had been stretched for the great
Bridge, and soon afterward the six years' labor
at Hell Gate culminated in the long-anticipated
blast. Ground had been broken for the
new Municipal Building, the Ocean Parkway
had been opened for travel, work had begun
on the Brooklyn elevated road, rapid transit
trains had begun running on Atlantic Avenue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the Manhattan Beach and Sea Beach railroads
were opened to Coney Island, which had
started upon its career as a great popular
watering-place and pleasure resort, and a line
of Annex ferryboats was opened between Jewell's
Wharf and Jersey City.</p>

<p>In the mayoralty contest of 1877 James
Howell, Jr., was elected on the Democratic
ticket. The bill which had passed the Legislature
at the previous session reduced the
Mayor's salary from $10,000 to $6000. Mayor
Howell took a strong interest in the progress
of the Bridge, and succeeded Henry C. Murphy
as a trustee.</p>

<p>Work on the Bridge advanced steadily during
the years 1877 and 1878. The breaking
of a strand of the cable at the New York
anchorage in June, 1878, resulted in the death
of several workmen. In April, 1880, farewell
services were held in St. Ann's Church, at
Washington and Prospect streets, preparatory
to the removal of the building, to make way
for the Bridge approach. The prospective
area of the approach necessitated the removal
of much property, and the slow work of demolition
and advance still continues, after fifteen
years, to present unsightly pictures at the
threshold of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Mayor Howell's message in January, 1880,
revealed the fact that the taxable value of
property in the city had reached $232,925,699,
which was an increase of nearly $3,000,000
over the figures for the previous year.</p>

<p>An important event for the city was the
passage in May, by the Legislature, of the
"Single Head" bill, by the provisions of which
the system of triple heads of departments was
abolished, and complete appointive power and
responsibility vested in the Mayor. This radical
step toward municipal reform and good
government was one which could not fail to
attract the attention of the country, since
Brooklyn was the first great city to take it,
and the experiment was watched with the
liveliest interest by all students of municipal
government.</p>

<p>John Fiske, in his admirable work on "Civil
Government," thus succinctly describes the
new system of city government: "Besides the
council of [nineteen] Aldermen, the people
elect only three city officers,&mdash;the Mayor,
comptroller, and auditor. The comptroller is
the principal finance officer and book-keeper
of the city; and the auditor must approve
bills against the city, whether great or small,
before they can be paid. The Mayor appoints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
without confirmation by the council, all executive
heads of departments; and these executive
heads are individuals, not boards. Thus there
is a single police commissioner, a single fire
commissioner, a single health commissioner,
and so on; and each of these heads appoints
his own subordinates; 'so that the principle
of defined responsibility permeates the city
government from top to <span class="locked">bottom.'<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> In a few
cases where the work to be done is rather
discretionary than executive in character, it is
intrusted to a board; thus, there is a board of
assessors, a board of education, and a board
of elections. These are all appointed by the
Mayor, but for terms not coincident with his
own; 'so that, in most cases, no Mayor would
appoint the whole of any such board unless he
were to be twice elected by the people.' But
the executive officers are appointed by the
Mayor for terms coincident with his own, that
is, for two years. 'The Mayor is elected at the
general election in November; he takes office
on the first of January following, and for one
month the great departments of the city are
carried on for him by the appointees of his predecessor.
On the first of January it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his duty to appoint his own heads of departments,'
and thus 'each incoming Mayor has
the opportunity to make an administration in
all its parts in sympathy with himself.'</p>

<p>"With all these immense executive powers
intrusted to the Mayor, however, he does not
hold the purse-strings. He is a member of a
board of estimates, of which the other four
members are the comptroller and auditor, with
the county treasurer and supervisor. This
board recommends the amount to be raised
by taxation for the ensuing year. These
estimates are then laid before the council of
Aldermen, who may cut down single items as
they see fit, but have not the power to increase
any item. The Mayor must see to it that the
administrative work of the year does not use
up more money than is thus allowed to <span class="locked">him."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The first Mayor to act under this charter
amendment was Seth Low, who was elected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in 1881, over Howell by a vote of 45,434 to
<span class="locked">40,937.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> Low, who was born in Brooklyn,
where his family had occupied a distinguished
position, and had graduated from Columbia
College in 1870, afterward entering the business
house of his father, was in his thirty-second
year when elected to office, a circumstance
which, added to the novelty of the conditions
under which his administration must work,
did not fail to attract special attention throughout
the country.</p>

<p>In his first message (January, 1882) Low
touched upon the important question of the
appointing <span class="locked">power:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The manifest purpose of the act is to
make the Mayor the responsible head of the
city government, and to secure a homogeneous
government by laying upon each Mayor the
necessity of making his appointments at the
beginning of his term. To accomplish this
purpose the act does some things by direct
provision and some things by implication. It
provides, in section I, that the terms of office
of certain specified officers shall expire on the
first of February, 1882. It then provides, in
section 6, that 'after the first day of January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
1882, the Mayor of the city of Brooklyn shall
have sole and exclusive power to appoint the
successor of any commissioner or other head
of department (except the department of
finance and the department of audit), or of
any assessor or member of the board of education
of said city, when the terms of such
officers shall respectively expire, or as by law
may then or thereafter be required to be appointed.'</p>

<p>"There are certain officers in the city whose
terms of office expired some time in the year
1881, to wit: The corporation counsel, the
city treasurer, the collector of taxes, and the
registrar of arrears, and to these officers
the charter amendment makes no distinct
reference. The reason that the present incumbents
hold over is that, by section 5 of
that amendment, all power to appoint during
1881 was taken away from the Mayor and
Common Council, where it formerly resided,
without being lodged anywhere else, except
that the sole power of filling vacancies during
1881 was lodged with the Mayor. The evident
purpose of this provision was to place the
appointment of the successors to the present
incumbents of these offices in the hands of the
Mayor to be elected by the people in 1881.
So much is clear; but it leaves two points uncertain:
First, when are the successors to the
present incumbents to be appointed? Second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
when appointed, is it for the balance of an unexpired
term, or for two years?</p>

<p>"I shall be governed by what I believe to
be the clear and intelligent purpose of the
law. I shall appoint the four officers alluded
to so that their terms shall begin practically
on the first of February, or at the same time
with the officers distinctly mentioned in the
act, and I shall appoint them for two years."</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking further of appointments and removals,
Low s<span class="locked">aid:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a matter of grave public concern for
the people to know in what spirit an officer
intrusted for the first time in the history of
our city with such powers purposes to use
them. The whole theory of the law is that
the Mayor shall be responsible for the administration
of the city's affairs, and for the policy
which animates the different departments. It
makes the relation of the different commissioners
and heads of departments to the Mayor
practically that of the cabinet officer to his
chief. I feel it to be a matter of no less importance
to my successors than to myself to
emphasize this thought. It is no reproach to
Mr. Evarts that President Garfield placed Mr.
Blaine at the head of the State Department.
It is no reproach to Mr. Blaine that President
Arthur has called Senator Frelinghuysen to
succeed him; and what is true of the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Department is equally true of a purely administrative
department like the post-office. It
will, therefore, be a great injustice to any official
who may be retired through my action to
interpret it into reproach upon him, just as it
would be equal injustice to me to assume that
I meant it as such; or to my successor, to
hamper him with any obligations toward my
appointees. The Mayor being responsible to
the people must be left free from such personal
embarrassments. I claim this right, as
I believe, in the interest of good government,
for my successors and for myself.</p>

<p>"The law does not give the Mayor the absolute
power of removal. I presume it was
not thought to be necessary. But the whole
purpose of the law will be defeated unless the
Mayor knows at all times and under all circumstances
that he is responsible because his
appointees represent him. If any of them get
out of harmony with him he must ask for their
resignations, and he is entitled to receive them
on demand. I hazard nothing in saying that
the people of Brooklyn elected me Mayor with
the full purpose of placing precisely this responsibility
upon me. As there is no precedent
to govern in this case, I wish to state
distinctly that the acceptance of an appointment
at my hands will be evidence to the
community that the gentleman accepting it
has personally given me his assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he will without delay give me his resignation
whenever I ask for it."</p></blockquote>

<p>The remainder of the message was in the
same spirit, and left the people of Brooklyn in
no doubt that the new Mayor meant to interpret
the movement represented by the charter
amendments in its most radical and reformatory
light.</p>

<p>Low was renominated in 1883. The Democrats
nominated Joseph C. <span class="locked">Hendrix,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> who led
a brilliant campaign. In a hotly contested
election that drew out an extraordinary vote,
Low was elected by a vote of 49,554 against
Hendrix's 48,006.</p>

<p>The two administrations of Low demonstrated
beyond question the availability of the
"Brooklyn system." In his message for 1884
the Mayor offered a strong plea in behalf of
the public schools, in which free books had
just been introduced.</p>

<p>The president of the board of education
made the following urgent presentation of the
<span class="locked">case:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Notwithstanding the number of new buildings
erected and occupied during the year, I
am unable to report any relief from the general
crowded condition that existed at the time
of my last report. The children come faster
than we can make room for them, and in some
localities for nearly every seat provided there
are two applicants. As evidence of the demand
made upon our new schools, at their
opening, by primary pupils, I cite the following:
The new primary building to relieve No.
24 was opened on the 4th inst., this being the
last of the new buildings. The crowd of children
with their parents seeking admission was
so great and the excitement so intense that for
two days two policemen were required to preserve
order at the doors. In a building seating
676 pupils 899 were registered, the average
age being 8 years. Only the fifth and sixth
primary grades are admitted to this building.
It is not pleasant for me to state that many of
these children, 9 and 10 years old, have never
before had a day's schooling, because there
was no public school into which they could
gain admittance. From the first day the class-rooms
have been devoted to half-day classes.</p>

<p>"The registry of attendance in October of
this year numbered 67,314 pupils. Our regular
seating capacity is but 64,200, or 3,114 less
than the actual attendance. We have 76
classes, numbering over 90 pupils each, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
this number 16 classes have over 140 each,
the largest class having 218 pupils. A large
proportion of these crowded classes are from
necessity divided into half-day sessions.</p>

<p>"This is our condition after redistricting the
city and reorganizing several schools, thereby
decreasing the number of grammar classes, and
increasing the number of primary classes by
eighteen, and after building eight new school
buildings,&mdash;we have been compelled to crowd
and pack our school rooms without due regard
to the convenience, comfort, and health of the
pupils and to the proper facilities and conditions
for imparting instruction....</p>

<p>"We have exhausted every means at our
disposal to utilize space save one. It is now
the purpose of the Committee on Studies to
so revise the course of study that all grammar
class-rooms will be full. When this has been
done we shall have no resource left by which
to gain space but to build new buildings."</p></blockquote>

<p>Possibly the most important achievement
in Low's administration was the framing and
passage of the Arrears Bill, which had an
immediate and salutary effect in the management
of the city's finances.</p>

<p>An historic event during the period of Low's
mayoralty was the opening of the Bridge on
Thursday, May 24, 1883. The two cities were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
greatly aroused by the event, and much enthusiasm
prevailed.</p>

<p>The ceremonies were held at the Brooklyn

<p>The ceremonies over which James S.&nbsp;T.

being called "Brooklyn's first citizen," presided,
drew a large and memorable company.
The military marshal of the day was Maj.-Gen.
James Jourdan, commanding the Second Division

were as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of his address Mayor Low
<span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the water of the lakes found the salt
sea when the Erie Canal was opened, so surely
will quick communication seek and find this
noble bridge; and as the ships have carried
hither and thither the products of the mighty
West, so shall diverging railroads transport
the people swiftly to their homes in the hospitable
city of Brooklyn. The Erie Canal is a
waterway through the land connecting the
great West with the older East. This bridge
is a landway over the water, connecting two
cities bearing to each other relations in some
respects similar. It is the function of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
works to bless 'both him that gives and him
that takes.' The development of the West
has not belittled, but has enlarged New York,
and Brooklyn will grow by reason of this
bridge, not at New York's expense, but to her
permanent advantage. The Brooklyn of 1900
can hardly be guessed at from the city of to-day.
The hand of Time is a mighty hand.
To those who are privileged to live in sight of
this noble structure every line of it should be
eloquent with inspiration. Courage, enterprise,
skill, faith, endurance,&mdash;these are the
qualities which have made the great bridge,
and these are the qualities which will make
our city great and our people great. God
grant they never may be lacking in our midst.
Gentlemen of the Trustees, in accepting the
bridge at your hands, I thank you warmly in
Brooklyn's name for your manifold and arduous
labors."</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking of a glance forward for twenty-five
years, Mayor Edson <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No one dares accept the possibilities that
are forced upon the mind in the course of its
contemplation. Will these two cities, ere then,
have been consolidated into one great municipality,
numbering within its limits more than
five millions of people? Will the right of
self-government have been accorded to the
great city, thus united, and will her people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
have learned how best to exercise that right?
Will the progress of improvement and the
preparation for commerce, manufactures, and
trade, and for the comforts of home for poor
and rich, have kept pace with the demand in
the great and growing city? Will the establishment
of life-giving parks, embellished with
appropriate fountains and statues and with
the numberless graces of art, which at once
gladden the eye, and raise the standard of civilization,
have kept abreast with its growth in
wealth and numbers? These are but few of
the pertinent questions which must be answered
by the zealous and honest acts of the
generation of men already in active life. Here
are the possibilities; all the elements and conditions
are here; but the results must depend
upon the wisdom and patriotism and energy
of those who shall lead in public affairs. May
they be clothed in a spirit of wisdom and
knowledge akin to that which inspired those
who conceived and executed the great work
which we receive at your hands and dedicate
to-day."</p></blockquote>

<p>The address of Abram S. Hewitt contained
these significant <span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am here by your favor to speak for the
city of New York, and I should be the last
person to throw any discredit on its fair fame;
but I think I only give voice to the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
feeling, when I say that the citizens of New
York are satisfied neither with the structure
of its government, nor with its actual administration,
even when it is in the hands of intelligent
and honest officials. Dissatisfied as we
are, no man has been able to devise a system
which commends itself to the general approval,
and it may be asserted that the remedy is not
to be found in devices for any special machinery
of government. Experiments without
number have been tried, and suggestions in
infinite variety have been offered, but to-day
no man can say that we have approached any
nearer to the idea of good government which
is demanded by the intelligence and the wants
of the community.</p>

<p>"If, therefore, New York has not yet learned
to govern itself, how can it be expected to be
better governed by adding half a million to its
population, and a great territory to its area,
unless it be with the idea that a 'little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump'? Is Brooklyn that
leaven? And if not, and if possibly 'the salt
has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted?'
Brooklyn is now struggling with this problem,
it remains to be seen with what success; but
meanwhile it is idle to consider the idea of
getting rid of our common evils by adding
them together. Beside, it is a fundamental
axiom in politics, approved by the experience
of older countries as well as our own, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sources of power should never be far removed
from those who are to feel its exercise. It is
the violation of this principle which produces
chronic revolution in France, and makes the
British rule so obnoxious to the Irish people.
This evil is happily avoided when a natural
boundary circumscribes administration within
narrow limits. While, therefore, we rejoice
together at the new bond between New York
and Brooklyn, we ought to rejoice the more
that it destroys none of the conditions which
permit each city to govern itself, but rather
urges them to a generous rivalry in perfecting
each its own government, recognizing the
truth that there is no true liberty without law,
and that eternal vigilance, which is the only
safeguard of liberty, can best be exercised
within limited areas. It would be a most fortunate
conclusion if the completion of this
bridge should arouse public attention to the
absolute necessity of good municipal government,
and recall the only principle upon which
it can ever be successfully founded. There is
reason to hope that this result will follow, because
the erection of this structure shows
how a problem, analogous to that which confronts
us in regard to the city government, has
been met and solved in the domain of physical
science."</p></blockquote>

<p>The brilliant oration of Dr. Storrs closed
with the following glowing passage:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Local and particular as is the work, therefore,
it represents that fellowship of the nations
which is more and more prominently a fact of
our times, and which gives to these cities incessant
augmentation. When by and by on
yonder island the majestic French statue of
'Liberty' shall stand, holding in its hand the
radiant crown of electric flames, and answering
by them to those as brilliant along this causeway,
our beautiful bay will have taken what
specially illuminates and adorns it from Central
and from Western Europe. The distant
lands from which oceans divide us, though we
touch them each moment with the fingers of
the telegraph, will have set their conspicuous
double crown on the head of our harbor. The
alliances of nations, the peace of the world,
will seem to find illustrious prediction in such
superb and novel regalia. Friends and fellow-citizens,
let us not forget that in the growth of
these cities, henceforth united and destined
ere long to be formally one, lies either a threat
or one of the most conspicuous promises of
the time. Cities have always been powers in
history. Athens educated Greece as well as
adorned it, while Corinth filled the throbbing
and thirsty Hellenic veins with poisoned
blood. The weight of Constantinople broke
the Roman Empire asunder. The capture of
the same magnificent city gave to the Turks
their establishment in Europe for the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
centuries. Even where they have not
had such a commanding preëminence of location,
the social, political, moral force proceeding
from cities has been vigorous, in impression,
immense in extent. The passion in
Paris, for a hundred years, has created or
directed the sentiment of France. Berlin is
more than the legislative or administrative
centre of the German Empire, and even a
government as autocratic as that of the Czar,
in a country as undeveloped as Russia, has to
consult the popular feeling of St. Petersburg
or of Moscow. In our nation, political power is
widely distributed, and the largest or wealthiest
commercial centre can have but its share.
Great as is the weight of the aggregate vote
in these henceforth compacted cities, the vote
of the State will always overbear it. Amid
the suffrages of the nation at large it can only
be reckoned as one of many consenting or
conflicting factors. But the influence which
constantly proceeds from these cities&mdash;on
their journalism not only, or on the issues of
their book presses, or on the multitudes going
forth from them&mdash;but on the example presented
in them, of educational, social, religious
life&mdash;this, for shadow and check, or for fine
inspiration, is already of unlimited extent, of
incalculable force. It must increase as they
expand, and are lifted before the country to a
new elevation. A larger and a smaller sun are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
sometimes associated, astronomers tell us, to
form a binary centre in the heavens, for what
is doubtless an unseen system receiving from
them impulse and light. On a scale not
utterly insignificant a parallel may be hereafter
suggested in the relation of these combined
cities to a part, at least, of our national
system. Their attitude and action during the
war&mdash;successfully closed under the gallant
military leadership of men whom we gladly
welcome and honor&mdash;were of vast advantage
to the national cause. The moral, political,
intellectual temper which dominates in them
as years go on, will touch with beauty or scar
with scorching and baleful heats extended
regions. Their religious life, as it glows in
intensity, or with a faint and failing lustre, will
be repeated in answering image from the
widening frontier. The beneficence which
gives them grace and consecration, and which,
as lately, they follow to the grave with universal
benediction; or, on the other hand, the
selfish ambitions which crowd and crush along
their streets, intent only on accumulated
wealth and its sumptuous display, or the glittering
vices which they accept and set on
high&mdash;these will make impressions on those
who never cross the continent to our homes,
to whom our journals are but names. Surely
we should not go from this hour, which marks
a new era in the history of these cities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which points to their future indefinite expansion,
without the purpose in each of us that so
far forth as in us lies, with their increase in
numbers, wealth, equipment, shall also proceed,
with equal step, their progress in whatever
is noblest and best in private and in
public life; that all which sets humanity forward
shall come in them to ampler endowment,
more renowned exhibition; so that,
linked together, as hereafter they must be,
and seeing 'the purple deepening in their
robes of power,' they may be always increasingly
conscious of fulfilled obligation to the
nation and to God; may make the land, at
whose magnificent gateway they stand, their
constant debtor, and may contribute their
mighty part toward that ultimate perfect human
society for which the seer could find no
image so meet or majestic as that of a city,
coming down from above, its stones laid with
fair colors, its foundations with sapphires, its
windows of agate, its gates of carbuncles, and
all its borders of pleasant stones, with the
sovereign promise resplendent above <span class="locked">it&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The receipts from all sources for the year
ending December 1, 1893, were as follows: City
of Brooklyn construction account, $150,000;
city of New York construction account,
$75,000; receipts from tolls, $1,252,908.04;
material sold, labor, etc., $559.91; interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
$2,426.03; rent, real estate, and telegraph
wires, $109,246.05. Total, $1,590,140.03.</p>

<p>The management of the Bridge was formed
under control of a board of twenty trustees,
eight being appointed by the Mayor, comptroller,
and auditor of Brooklyn, and eight by
the Mayor, comptroller, and president of the
Board of Aldermen of New York city. Under
an act of the Legislature, passed April 4,
1893, on April 12 following, this board was
replaced by the present board of trustees, consisting
of two persons appointed by the Mayor
of the city of Brooklyn, two persons appointed
by the Mayor of the city of New York, at a
salary of $3000 each, and the mayors and
comptrollers of the two cities, members <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex
officio</i>, the appointed trustees to hold office for
five years.</p>

<p>Supplementing the work of the Bridge are
the elevated railroads and the electric or "trolley"
system. Six steam railroads run into
the city, four running to Coney Island, one to
Rockaway Beach, and one, the Long Island
Railroad, connecting with the railroad system
of Long Island. Sixteen ferries connect the
bay and river front with New York. The
New York and Brooklyn Ferry Company carried
about 16,000,000 passengers in 1893.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
The boundaries of the city, measuring about
thirty-two miles, include an extended water
front that is one of the most picturesque in
the country. The Erie basin and Atlantic
docks on the southern extremity of the line
represent an immense industry in grain shipments.
Grain-elevators, coaling-stations, store-houses,
the chief naval station in the United
States, and the big establishments of the greatest
sugar-refining district in the world, combine
to give the river front an unusual interest.</p>

<p>The great docks on the southwestern water
front represent important industries in which
Brooklyn occupies a foremost place. The
Atlantic basin covers forty acres, and is surrounded
by brick and granite warehouses on
three sides. These are 100 feet in depth, and
three to five stories high. The basin contains
four piers, three of which are covered, and are
700, 800, and 900 feet in length, by 80 feet in
width. South central pier, 900 feet long, is
the largest in the port. In the basin are seven
elevators, six of which are controlled by the
New York Grain Warehousing Company, the
seventh being owned by Pinto Brothers. Atlantic
basin is the largest grain-depot in the
world. Its frontage line of basin and piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
measures three miles. South central pier is
leased by the Union Hamburg and the Nicaragua
and Central American lines of steamships.
Barber &amp; Co. and T. Hogan &amp; Sons
control the east central pier; Funch &amp; Edye's
steamships dock at the south central pier, as
do the lines to Bordeaux and Oporto. At the
west central pier many goods from the Indies
are unloaded, especially plumbago and cocoa-nut
oil. The entrance to the basin is 200
feet in width. The north pier is much used
by Italian barks. The basin has a uniformed
police force of its own.</p>

<p>In this region also are finely appointed
shipyards and dry docks, the Anglo-American
docks, opened in 1866, being the largest in
the United States. The chamber of Dock
No. 1 is 510 feet in length, and that of Dock
No. 2,610 feet. Most of the large iron ships
that are docked at the port of New York are
hauled up here. On the old Williamsburgh
water front are the vast sugar-refineries, the
greatest group of the kind in the world, and
representing Brooklyn's greatest manufacturing
interest. The output of most of these
great hives of industry is now controlled by
the American Sugar Refining Company. The
largest of the refineries melts 2000 tons of raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sugar per day, producing over 12,000 barrels
of refined sugar. Vessels from the West
Indies and other points as remote as Java line
the piers at this part of the water front, loading
with barreled sugar.</p>

<p>Large cooperages and extensive oil refineries
occupy the water front to the north, the great
Standard Oil Company having its plant in this
region.</p>

<p>The United States reservation, known as
the Navy Yard, occupies about 112 acres in
the bend of the river to which the Dutch gave
the name that still clings, the Wallabout.
This is the chief naval station of the United
States. It contains trophies of the three great
wars, and the 6000 feet of water front is always
made interesting by the presence of one
or more ships of war.</p>

<p>In 1884 Brooklyn obtained from the United
States Government a lease of the 422,525
square feet of land on the east of the Navy
Yard, and adjoining the Wallabout canal.
On this plot a large market has grown up and
supplied the city with a marketing centre of
which it long stood in need. In July, 1890,
an act of Congress authorized the sale of the
fee-simple of the land to Brooklyn; the city
authorities completing the purchase in November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
1891, at the valuation of $700,000.
Later, an additional purchase of adjoining
land from the federal government extended
the market property to the Wallabout canal,
and enabled the increase of the number of lots
for stands to 120. The present area of the
market lands is bounded as follows: On the
north by the Wallabout canal; on the east by
the lands of the United States Naval Hospital;
on the south by Flushing Avenue, and
on the west by Washington Avenue.</p>

<p>In December, 1892, the national government
authorized the sale to Brooklyn of additional
lands of the Navy Yard reservation,
abutting upon the west side of Washington
Avenue, and embraced between that avenue
and a line on a continuation of Clinton Avenue,
Flushing Avenue, and the East River,&mdash;a
tract which would more than double in extent
the area of the market possessions.</p>

<p>Brooklyn's boundaries on the east and south
touch a number of large cemeteries, most
noted of which is Greenwood, which holds
many distinguished dead, and many notable
monuments. In 1893 there were 5519 interments
at the cemetery of the Evergeens, and
during the same year 3000 at Cypress Hills,
and 18,000 at Calvary Cemetery. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
not less than thirty cemeteries within the
county, a fact that presents a serious problem
in the extension of the city's lines.</p>

<p>The development of Prospect Park has been
a matter of great pride and gratification to
the city. In recent years the park has been
adorned by a number of statues. J.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T.
Stranahan has received the unique honor of a
public statue in his lifetime. In the plaza is
the statue of Lincoln already mentioned.
Within the park are busts of Thomas Moore,
Washington Irving, and of John Howard
Payne, one of Long Island's sons.</p>

<p>The Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Arch in
the Park Plaza was proposed by Seth Low in
a speech at Greenwood, on Decoration Day.
The Legislature voted $250,000, subscriptions
were raised, the competition for a suitable design
was won by John H. Duncan, the corner-stone
was laid in 1889, and the monument
was finished in 1892.</p>

<p>The Municipal Building was finished in
1878, at a cost of $200,000, and the Hall of
Records adjoining the county Court House
in 1886, at a cost of $275,000. The most
imposing public building in the city is the
Federal Building, bounded by Washington,
Johnson, and Adams streets. This massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
structure of Maine granite contains the central
post-office quarters, and the federal courts
and offices. The site cost $413,594.12, and
the building $1,258,057.06.</p>

<p>Some of the most important building operations
in recent years have expressed the enterprises
of the great bazaars, gathered most
thickly on Fulton Street, but appearing also
on other leading thoroughfares.</p>

<p>A glance at the buildings of the city quickly
suggests the remarkable increase in the number
of theatres.</p>

<p>According to Gabriel Harrison's "History
of the Drama in Brooklyn" the first dramatic
performance in the city took place in a stone
building on the north side of "the old road"
(Fulton Street), near the corner of Front
Street. This building had been known for
thirty years or more as Corporation House,
belonging to the corporation of the city of
New York. It contained a tavern and a ferry
room on its ground floor and a hall on the
second. When the British gained possession
of Brooklyn the house changed hands, and
was known while they remained as the King's
Head. It was fitted as a resort for officers
and men, and all sorts of amusements were
offered, from bull-baiting to games of chance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
George III.'s birthday was celebrated by illuminations
and fish dinners, to which the
Tories of New York came over in rowboats.
At the first dramatic performances here an
original farce was acted, of which General
John Burgoyne was the alleged author. It
was called "The Battle of Brooklyn." The
title-page reads: "The Battle of Brooklyn;
a farce in two acts, as it was performed in
Long Island on Tuesday, 27th day of August,
1776, by the representatives of the Tyrants of
America, assembled in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>There were also dramatic performances in
Greene's Military Garden in 1810, and later.
An amphitheatre was built on Fulton Street
in 1828. The assembly rooms of Military Garden
were converted into a theatre in 1848.
Chanfrau and Burke opened the Brooklyn
Museum in 1850. The Odeon was built on
the site of the present Novelty or Proctor's
Theatre on Driggs Street, in 1852. It was
afterward known as Apollo Hall. Washington
Hall, afterward called the Comique, was
built at the corner of Broadway and Fourth
Street (now Bedford Avenue); Hooley's
Opera House, at Court and Remsen streets, in
1862, and the Park Theatre was built a year
later. The Brooklyn Theatre was opened in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
1871, and rebuilt after the <span class="locked">fire.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Hyde &amp;
Behman's Theatre was built in 1877, the
Grand Opera House in 1881, the Criterion in
1885, the Amphion in 1888. The completion
of the fine Columbia Theatre on Washington
Street was due to the enterprise of Edwin
Knowles, who had been a successful manager
of the Grand Opera House, and subsequently
of the Amphion.</p>

<p>The newer city armories are further important
additions to the city architecture.</p>

<p>On the first day of January, 1894, the military
organizations of Brooklyn, comprising,
with the Seventeenth Separate Company of
Flushing, the entire Second Brigade of the
New York National Guard, numbered about
3000 men. The strength of the brigade in
1892, as shown at inspection, was 3084. In
this number were included the 403 officers and
men of the Thirty-second Regiment, shortly
afterward disbanded. Very few members of
that organization are now in the service. In
1893, inspections of the several commands were
held, as follows: Seventeenth Separate Company,
April 3; Signal Corps, October 10; Third
Battery, October 11; Forty-seventh Regiment,
October 18; Fourteenth Regiment, October<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
19; Thirteenth Regiment, October 21;
Twenty-third Regiment, October 26. The
Thirteenth and Fourteenth regiments, which
did not go to the state camp last year, were inspected
in the afternoon at Prospect Park.
Below is shown the attendance of each <span class="locked">organization:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The difficulties arising from inadequate
school accommodations, to meet which Mayor
Low and other mayors had urged broad and
sufficient action, continued to hamper the
action of the department of public instruction.
The development of the department under the
superintendency of William H. Maxwell has
been along thoroughly modern lines. Recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
reforms have had a tendency to improve the
quality of teachers by placing obstacles in the
path of the incompetent. To a considerable
extent these reforms have diminished the
chances of political interference in the working
of the school system.</p>

<p>The successful establishment, in 1878, of a
Central Grammar School, admitting graduates
from the public schools, was followed by the
organization of separate high schools for boys
and girls, and afterward by a manual training
school, and a movement for the establishment
of kindergarten classes and definite means of
physical culture. On October 31, 1893, there
were on register in the public schools of the
city 102,468 pupils,&mdash;more than 2000 in excess
of the sittings. For many years preceding
this date a large number of classes had
provided a half day's schooling only for the
registered pupils, forcing the teachers of these
classes to assume responsibility for two large
classes of children on each school day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
  <img id="if_i200" src="images/i200.jpg" width="206" height="584" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption">STATUE OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON IN FRONT OF THE HAMILTON CLUB HOUSE
</div></div>

<p>In his report for the year ending December
31, 1892, Superintendent Maxwell <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The child that begins the school course at
six ought to complete it easily, and be ready
to enter the high school, at the age of fourteen.
In every grade, however, the average age is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
about one year higher than it ought to be.
There is now a well ascertained consensus of
opinion among educational authorities that
this delay in reaching the high school&mdash;in
getting at such disciplinary studies as languages,
geometry, and natural science&mdash;is
detrimental not only to the individual child
but to the public welfare. In some cases this
delay is doubtless caused by protracted illness
or general physical weakness; in some, by the
mania&mdash;I can call it by no other name&mdash;which
some principals and teachers have for
holding back pupils from promotion; in some,
by positive dullness or slowness of wit; but in
the majority of cases it arises from the crowded
condition of the lower primary classes. Instead
of accommodating more children by
swelling the registers of these classes, we are
accommodating fewer. The teachers in these
classes, work as hard as they may, are able to
prepare but a small proportion of their classes
for promotion; while by reason of lack of
proper teaching in the introductory classes&mdash;a
lack which is not chargeable to the teachers&mdash;the
pupils are less able than they otherwise
would be to do the work of the higher grades
as they advance. The consequence is that
pupils are put through our schools more slowly
and in smaller numbers than they ought to
be. If in a piece of machinery or in a living
organism a greater strain is put on any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
part than it is able to bear, the strength and
efficiency of the whole are proportionately
diminished. Just so it is with our school system.
The strain put upon the seventh primary
teachers by choking up their classes
impairs the efficiency of the entire system.
The only rational conclusion is that <em>the number
of pupils to a class must be limited</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The movement toward centralizing responsibility
in the school principals began at this
time to gather force. It was warmly supported
by the superintendent.</p>

<p>In the Girls' High School, in 1893, the
number of registered pupils was 1626; in the
Boys' High School, 692. The annual appropriation
for schools in 1893 was $2,449,735.33;
from the city, $1,996,500.00; from the State,
$394,414.82; other sources, $58,820.51.</p>

<p>A training school for teachers was established
in 1885. From this admirable institution
the graduates increased in number from
48 in 1886 to 70 in 1892.</p>

<p>With the educational interests of Brooklyn
the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences is
closely associated. In the summer of 1823
several gentlemen, among whom was Augustus
Graham, met at Stevenson's Tavern for
the purpose of establishing for the apprentices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of Brooklyn a free <span class="locked">library.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> They adopted
a constitution, and issued to the citizens of
Brooklyn a circular, in which they solicited
donations of books and money with which to
effect their purpose. On November 20, 1824,
they were incorporated by the Legislature of
the State under the name of "The Brooklyn
Apprentices' Library Association," and on July
4, 1825, the corner-stone of the first building
owned by the association was laid by General
Lafayette, at the junction of Henry and Cranberry
streets. As early as 1835 the association
had outgrown its original quarters, and
the property having been sold to the city the
institution was removed to a new building in
Washington Street, then the centre of the
wealth and culture of our young city. The
first lecture delivered in the newly completed
structure was by Prof. James D. Dana.</p>

<p>In order to broaden the scope of the association,
an amended charter was granted by
the Legislature in 1843, and the name therein
changed to "The Brooklyn Institute." For
many years thereafter the Institute was a most
important factor in the social, literary, scientific,
and educational life of Brooklyn. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
library had a large circulation; in its public
hall took place many social and historic gatherings,
and from its platform were heard such
eminent scientific men as Agassiz, Dana, Gray,
Henry, Morse, Mitchell, Torrey, Guyot, and
Cooke; such learned divines as Drs. McCosh,
Hitchcock, Storrs, and Buddington, and such
defenders of the liberties of the people as
Phillips, Sumner, Garrison, Emerson, Everett,
Curtis, King, Bellows, Chapin, and Beecher.</p>

<p>During this brilliant period of its history
(1843&ndash;1867), the Institute received from Mr.
Graham two very important donations. On
July 4, 1848, the building, which had been
heavily mortgaged, he presented to the trustees
free from all incumbrance, and through
his will, made known to the board of directors
on November 28, 1851, shortly after his decease,
he bequeathed to the Institute the sum
of $27,000, as a permanent endowment fund.
The will directs that the interest of $10,000
of this sum shall be used in the support of lectures
on scientific subjects and in the purchase
of apparatus and collections illustrating the
sciences; that the interest of $12,000 shall be
used in the support of Sunday evening lectures
on "The Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of
God as manifested in His Works," and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the balance of $5,000 shall be used in the support
of a school of design and in forming a
gallery of fine arts.</p>

<p>For several years, however, prior to 1867,
owing to the erection of the Academy of Music
and other public buildings, the Institute
building was regarded as behind the times.
The income from rental of portions of the
building was dwindling to a low figure, and
the financial support of the free library was
becoming inadequate. Under these circumstances
the directors remodeled the building
in 1867, at an expense of about $3,000, a part
of which was raised by life-membership subscriptions
of $50 and $100, and the balance
by a mortgage on the building. For twenty
years (1867&ndash;87) this indebtedness necessitated
the application of a portion of the income from
the rent of the building and from the Graham
endowment fund to the payment of the interest
and the principal of the debt. Final payment
on the mortgage was made early in 1887.</p>

<p>The causes of the partial inactivity of the
Institute during the twenty years (1867&ndash;87)
are therefore apparent. The most that it was
able to do was to circulate its library, keep up
its classes in drawing, and provide for the
annual addresses on the 22d of February.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Freed from debt in 1887, the Institute was
enabled once more to use the whole income
from its funds and building for educational
purposes, and again to become an important
agent in the work of education in the city.</p>

<p>The property of the Institute in 1887 consisted
of the Institute building and land, valued
at $90,000, a library of 12,000 volumes, a
collection of paintings valued at $10,000, and
endowment funds of $46,000. These last
comprise the $27,000 bequeathed by Mr. Graham,
the William H. Cary fund of $10,000
for the support of the library, and an increment
of $9,000 realized through premiums on
the sale of bonds.</p>

<p>During the year 1887&ndash;88 a new era in the
history of the Institute was inaugurated. The
board of trustees determined to make the
property of the Institute the nucleus of a broad
and comprehensive institution for the advancement
of science and art, and its membership a
large and active association, laboring not only
for the advancement of knowledge, but also
for the education of the people, through lectures
and collections, in art and science. It
was observed that while Boston had the Lowell
Institute, a society of natural history, and an
art museum; while Philadelphia had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Franklin Institute, an academy of sciences,
and a gallery of fine arts; and while New
York had the Metropolitan Museum and the
American Museum, yet that Brooklyn had
nothing corresponding to these institutions.
It was felt that Brooklyn should have an institute
of arts and sciences worthy of her
wealth, her position, her culture, and her people;
that it was her duty to do more than she
was then doing for the education and enjoyment
of her people, and that some step should
be taken looking towards the future growth
and needs of the city in matters of art and
science.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a form of organization was
adopted which contemplated the formation of
a large association of members, and a continual
increase of the endowment funds and the
collections of the Institute. Provision was
made for a subdivision of the membership into
departments, representing various branches of
art and science, each department forming a
society by itself and yet enjoying all the privileges
of the general association. A general
invitation was extended to citizens specially
interested in science and art to become members
of the Institute. Courses of lectures on
science and art were provided. The directors'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
room of the Institute was enlarged to
accommodate the meetings of some of the
departments contemplated, and a large lecture-room
on the third floor of the Institute building
was fitted up at an expense of $2600 for
the occupancy of those departments that would
make use of apparatus and collections at their
meetings.</p>

<p>During the first fifteen months after the
reorganization of the Institute a membership
of three hundred and fifty persons was recorded.
The Brooklyn Microscopical Society
joined the Institute in a body, with sixty-four
members, and became the Department of
Microscopy. The American Astronomical
Society, whose members resided mostly in
New York and Brooklyn, became the Department
of Astronomy, with thirty-two members.
The Brooklyn Entomological Society united
with the Institute, and became the Entomological
Department, with forty-one members.
The Linden Camera Club of Brooklyn became
the Department of Photography, with twenty-six
members. Departments of physics, chemistry,
botany, mineralogy, geology, zoölogy,
and archæology were successively formed.
Each of the above twelve departments began
to hold monthly meetings. The permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
funds and property of the Institute were increased
$3000. Additions were made to the
library, and its circulation increased from
12,000 to 36,000 volumes per year. The lecture
courses were fully attended. The classes
in drawing were enlarged, and a general citizens'
movement to secure a museum of arts
and sciences for Brooklyn was inaugurated.</p>

<p>The subsequent growth of the Institute has
been remarkable. The old building on Washington
Street was burned in 1890, and the
work was continued in temporary quarters,
chiefly in the building of the Young Men's
Christian Association on Fulton Street. During
the fourth year of active work after the
reorganization 632 new members were recorded.
The real estate belonging to the old
Brooklyn Institute on Washington Street was
sold to the trustees of the New York and
Brooklyn Bridge, and the old Institute was
formally consolidated with the new Brooklyn
Institute of Arts and Sciences. By an act of
the Legislature the city was authorized to
expend $300,000 in the erection of a Museum
of Arts and Sciences on Prospect Hill, on a
favorable site bounded by the Eastern Parkway,
Washington Avenue, old President Street,
and the Prospect Hill reservoir. In the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
1892, 940 new members were added, bringing
the total up to 2622; the number of lectures
and class exercises open to members and
others, by the payment of a moderate fee, was
1397, as against 1134 the previous year; the
number of concerts was increased from eight
to fifteen; the average daily attendance on all
the exercises of the Institute for the eight
months of active work was 936, and the total
attendance for the year, 190,900; the annual
income was increased from $18,934.20 in the
previous year to $31,641.58; special courses
of lectures were delivered on American history
from the time of Columbus to the beginning of
this century, and a special course of addresses
was given by college presidents on educational
problems; Institute extension courses of lectures
were given in the eastern section of the
city; the school of political science was established,
with four classes and ninety-six pupils;
the Brooklyn art school was transferred to
new and larger quarters in the Ovington
Studio Building, and the number of pupils
was increased from ninety-four to one hundred
and twenty-eight; the department of architecture,
acting through its advisory board,
devised a scheme of competition for the best
plan and design for the proposed Museum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Arts and Sciences, which was accepted by the
board of trustees, and adopted by the Mayor
and park commissioner, and the competition
so arranged resulted in the award to the distinguished
New York architects, McKim,
Mead &amp; White.</p>

<p>Foremost among those who have brought
the Institute to its present influential position
in the city have been Gen. John B. Woodward
and Prof. Franklin W. Hooper. Professor
Hooper, who had been elected curator
of the Institute in 1889, became director of the
new Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1891.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the
establishment of Packer Institute and the
Polytechnic Institute. The handsome gift of
Mrs. Wm. S. Packer resulted in the opening
of an academy for the education of young
women. Since the time of the opening in
1854, under the presidency of Dr. Alonzo
Crittenden, the Packer Collegiate Institute
has enjoyed a peculiar prominence in the
educational work of the city, and has won a
high, if not a foremost, place among academies
of the kind in the United States. Dr. Crittenden
was succeeded in 1883 by Dr. Truman
G. Backus, who had filled the professorship
of English language and literature at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Vassar, and whose brilliant attainments as a
scholar and director have given new distinction
to the institute.</p>

<p>A commanding position likewise has been
gained by the Polytechnic Institute, whose
establishment as an academy for young men
resulted from the successful movement, aided
by the gift of Mrs. Packer, for the establishment
of a young women's school. A building
on Livingston Street was completed and
opened in 1855, Dr. John H. Raymond then
being president of the faculty. Dr. Raymond
was succeeded by Dr. David Henry Cochran,
who had for ten years been principal of the
State Normal School at Albany. Under a
new charter, secured in 1890, the Brooklyn
Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute received
"all the rights, powers, and dignities given
by the law and the ordinances of the <span class="locked">regents<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
to a college, including membership in the
University of the State of New York." Dr.
Henry Sanger Snow, an alumnus and a trustee
of the institute, took a leading part in the
negotiations which resulted in the significant
change. The new building adjoining the old
was first occupied in September, 1891.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The Adelphi Academy began its life in
1869 as a private school for both sexes. In
1886 Charles Pratt, then president of the
board of trustees, made gifts to the Institute,
by means of which it secured a new building
that was opened in 1888. The since extended
buildings now occupy a large part of the block
bounded by Lafayette Avenue, St. James
Place, Clifton Place, and Grand Avenue. The
preparatory, academic, and collegiate departments
are supplemented by a kindergarten
and a physical-training school. Art education
has always occupied an important place in the
Adelphi Academy. Many well-known artists
have graduated from the art school superintended
by Prof. J.&nbsp;B. Whittaker. The principals
of the Adelphi since its establishment
have been John Lockwood, Homer B. Sprague,
Stephen G. Taylor, Albert C. Perkins, John
S. Crombie, and Charles H. Levermore.</p>

<p>It is to Charles Pratt, who took so important
a part in bringing Adelphi Academy to
its present position, that Brooklyn is indebted
for the school which, more than any other
educational institution within its borders, is
distinctively original and of a national fame.
Pratt Institute is frequently compared with
Cooper Institute in New York. The comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
between the wise beneficence of Cooper
and that of Pratt is, indeed, interestingly close;
but the likeness between the two great schools
is less perfect. Pratt Institute's remarkable
characteristics are the result of a wise idea
logically worked out. The buildings on Ryerson
Street and Grand Avenue contain a unique
combination of departments under a form of
management that has proved to be eminently
practical and progressive. Its educational plan
illustrates manual and industrial training, as
well as education in high-school and artistic
branches. The methods of teaching domestic
art, as well as political, economic, and natural
science, have excited the admiration of students
of education throughout the country.
The large free library is one of many features
of the institution.</p>

<p>The kindergarten idea in Brooklyn has had
its leading exponent in Froebel Academy on
Tompkins Square. Among other private
educational institutions are St. John's College,
the most prominent of the Roman Catholic
schools, situated on Lewis Avenue, between
Willoughby Avenue and Hart Street; St.
Francis College, Bedford Academy, St. Joseph's
Institute, Brooklyn Heights Seminary,
Long Island Business College, Brooklyn Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
School, Bryant &amp; Stratton's Business College,
Miss Rounds's School for Girls, Kissick's Business
College, and Browne's Business College.</p>

<p>In special education the Long Island College
Hospital and the Brooklyn College of
Pharmacy occupy an important place. The
Long Island College Hospital and Training
School for Nurses was chartered in 1858. Its
history as a hospital and as a college has been
notable. The graduates in 1893 numbered
60, bringing the total list of graduates nearly
to 1500.</p>

<p>It frequently has been lamented that Brooklyn
has no great free library, and the deficiency
is one for which the city deserves a mark of
discredit. But it is due to Brooklyn to observe
that she is by no means without excellent
opportunities for those who wish to read.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Library, which succeeded
the old Mercantile Library, is not free to the
public, but the subscription rate is so low in
comparison with the privileges that the institution
is in many respects to be regarded as a
great public library. The building on Montague
Street was finished in 1868 at a cost of
$227,000, and its beautiful Gothic front forms
one of the genuine ornaments of the city.</p>

<p>The library contains nearly 200,000 volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
admirably selected. The catalogue compiled
by Stephen B. Noyes was of a character
to bring honor alike to library and librarian.
Upon the death of Mr. Noyes the management
of the library came into the competent hands
of W.&nbsp;A. Bardwell, who became librarian in
1888. The reading-rooms are furnished with
300 periodicals and newspapers. In the reference
departments there were 75,000 readers
in 1893, and in the reading-rooms 100,000
readers. The Brooklyn Library has, indeed,
performed an immensely important service in
the development of the city.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Institute Free Library, formerly
in the old Institute Building on Washington
Street, and now at 502 Fulton Street,
contains 16,000 well-selected volumes, and is
efficiently managed. Pratt Institute Free
Library is a notable instance of a great public
service through a private agency. The library
of 42,000 volumes includes 2000 German and
2000 French books. There are an Astral
Branch at Franklin Avenue and Java Street,
and delivery stations at Froebel Academy and
754 Driggs Avenue. Reading-room and library
are free to the use of all residents of Brooklyn.
The Long Island Free Library, at 571 Atlantic
Avenue, is the result of a well-directed movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
There are but 15,000 volumes, but
method of selection and distribution have assured
the usefulness of the work. To this
must be added the free public school libraries,
and the substantial free library of the Union
for Christian Work on Schermerhorn Street.</p>

<p>The free library of the Long Island Historical
Society naturally occupies an important
place. The reference department of 48,000
volumes includes the noteworthy publications
of the society itself. The Law Library in the
Court House contains 15,000 volumes, and
there are 7000 volumes in the library of the
Kings County Medical Society.</p>

<p>In addition to the libraries of the Young
Men's and the Young Women's Christian
<span class="locked">associations,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> there are over twenty-five special
free reading-rooms throughout the city, most
of them connected with churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
The large number of churches, and the
emphasis laid upon church interests, once
gave to Brooklyn the title of the City of
Churches. The proportion between the number
of churches and the population no longer
is so exceptional as to justify such a title, but
church life in Brooklyn is, in many respects,
of unique prominence. The greatest preacher
the United States has produced, Henry Ward
<span class="locked">Beecher,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> occupied the pulpit of Plymouth
Church during a great formative period in the
city's history. The Rev. Richard S. Storrs,
D.&nbsp;D., pastor of the Congregational Church of
the Pilgrims since 1846, the descendant of a
distinguished family of preachers and orators,
who has been called the "Chrysostom of
Brooklyn," occupies a place among the most
scholarly of American orators. The popularity
of the Rev. T. De Witt Talmage, pastor
of the Brooklyn Tabernacle since 1869, has
been unexampled in the church history of the
country. The thirty years' pastorate of the
Rev. Theodore L. Cuyler, at the Lafayette
Avenue Presbyterian Church, constituted a
notable force in the advancement of the community.
The enlightened leadership of the
Catholic Church by the Right Reverend John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Loughlin, first bishop of Brooklyn, who was
succeeded in 1892 by the Right Reverend
Charles E. McDonnell, has been a matter for
congratulation in the Catholic Church; and
the Episcopal Church has been under no less
obligation to the first bishop of the Protestant
Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, the
Right Reverend A.&nbsp;N. Littlejohn, D.&nbsp;D.
When Dr. Littlejohn was elected bishop in
1869, he was succeeded as rector of Holy
Trinity Church by the Rev. Charles Henry
Hall, D.&nbsp;D., who has been one of Brooklyn's
strongest preachers.</p>

<p>St. James' Church, at Jay and Chapel streets,
has been the cathedral church of the Catholic
diocese for nearly half a century. The corner-stone
of a great cathedral, to occupy the block
bounded by Lafayette, Clermont, Greene, and
Vanderbilt avenues, was laid in 1868, but only
a part of the structure has been completed.</p>

<p>In 1893 the following were the numbers of
churches of different denominations in Brooklyn:
Baptist, 40; Congregational, 26; German
Evangelical Association, 5; Jewish, 10;
Lutheran, 27; Methodist Episcopal, 53;
Primitive Methodist, 4; Methodist Free, 1;
Methodist Protestant, 1; Presbyterian, 33;
Roman Catholic, 63; Reformed Presbyterian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
1; United Presbyterian, 3; Protestant Episcopal,
45; Reformed Episcopal, 2; Dutch
Reformed, 19; Unitarian, 4; Universalist, 5;
miscellaneous, 23.</p>

<p>In the county towns the churches are numbered
as follows: Baptist, 1; Hebrew, 1; Lutheran,
5; Methodist Episcopal, 9; Protestant
Episcopal, 8; Methodist Protestant, 1; Reformed,
8; Roman Catholic, 12. In 1893 there
were ten so-called Chinese Sunday-schools in
Brooklyn, most of them connected with Protestant
churches, and said to enroll 200 <span class="locked">members.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>Religious societies in Brooklyn include a
large list of prosperous and efficient bodies.
Among these may be mentioned the Catholic
Historical Society, the Union Missionary
Training Institute, the Baptist Church Extension
Society, Baptist Social Union, City Bible
Society, Church Society of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, City Mission and Tract
Society, Brooklyn Sunday School Union,
Eastern District Sabbath School Association,
Brooklyn Theosophical Society, Brotherhood
of Christian Unity, Church Charity Foundation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Congregational Church Extension Society,
Congregational Club, Foreign Sunday
School Association, German Young Men's
Christian Association, Greenpoint Sunday
School Association, Greenpoint Young Men's
Christian Association, Kings County Sunday
School Association, Long Island Baptist
Association, Order of Deaconesses of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, Women's Auxiliary,
Unitarian Club, Universalist Club, and
the Young People's Baptist Union.</p>

<p>Brooklyn's churches occupy a particularly
intimate relation with the intellectual and
social life of the city. The circumstances
under which the Rev. John W. Chadwick,
D.&nbsp;D., became a leader in that highly significant
intellectual movement, the Brooklyn
Ethical Association, which has held meetings
during a number of seasons at the Second
Unitarian Church, and under which the Rev.
John Coleman Adams, D.&nbsp;D., instituted the
free historical lectures to public school children
at All Souls Universalist Church, have
been typical of a wholesome and progressive
tendency in the community.</p>

<p>The work of the churches is supplemented
by many and admirable organizations devoted
to the relief of the weak, destitute, and incompetent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
An important position is occupied by
the Association for Improving the Condition
of the Poor. The Brooklyn Bureau of Charities,
with central offices on Schermerhorn
Street, has "the general purpose of promoting
the welfare of the poor, the suffering, and
the friendless in the city of Brooklyn. The
specific objects and methods include: The promotion
of cordial coöperation between benevolent
societies, churches, and individuals; the
maintenance of a body of friendly visitors to
the poor; the encouragement of thrift, self-dependence,
and industry; the provision of temporary
employment and industrial instruction."</p>

<p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul undertakes
the general relief of the poor, without
regard to color or creed, the work being done
by a conference in each church (Catholic).
The society is governed by a council composed
of the president and vice-president of
each conference.</p>

<p>A number of industrial agencies have been
devised for the purpose of supplying temporary
work for men and women. A bureau of relief
for needy veterans of the Rebellion was established
in Grand Army quarters at the City
Hall. In recent years the number of free dispensaries
throughout the city has greatly increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
The Brooklyn Hospital, incorporated in
1845, received valuable aid from Augustus
Graham, the founder of the Brooklyn Institute.
The present hospital at Raymond
Street and De Kalb Avenue has been in
operation since 1852. St. Catherine's Hospital
was established in 1869. The Memorial
Hospital for women and children was founded
in 1881; the Methodist Episcopal Hospital in
the same year; St. Mary's Hospital in 1878;
St. John's Hospital in 1871; the German
Hospital in 1889; the Lutheran Hospital in
1881; the Brooklyn Hospital for Contagious
Diseases in 1891; St. Peter's Hospital in 1864;
the Brooklyn Home for Consumptives in 1864;
the Eastern District Dispensary and Hospital
in 1851; the Long Island Throat and Lung
Hospital in 1889; the Brooklyn Throat Hospital
in 1889; the Brooklyn Hom&oelig;opathic
Hospital in 1852; the Brooklyn Eye and Ear
Hospital in 1868; the Kings County Hospital
(a county institution) in 1837; the Brooklyn
Maternity in 1870; the Faith Home for Incurables
in 1878; the Inebriates' Home for
Kings County in 1867.</p>

<p>For the protection and relief of children,
the city has the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, the Children's Aid Society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the Industrial School Association, with
six branches, the Nursery and Infants' Hospital,
the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum,
the Hebrew Orphan Asylum, the Orphan
Asylum Society, the Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum Society, with three branches; the
Eastern District Industrial School, the Sheltering
Arms Nursery, St. Giles's Home, St.
Vincent's Home for Boys, St. Christopher's
Day Nursery, and St. Malachi's Home.</p>

<p>Brooklyn's right to the title of the City of
Homes, rather than to that of the City of
Churches, is excellently supported by a study
of its social life; and in no phase is this peculiarity
more apparent than in the club life
of the city, which is distinctly in harmony with
the general social life of the city. Several of
the city clubs have "ladies' nights," or special
receptions to which ladies are invited, and to
some of the clubs ladies are admitted at certain
hours of the day. "The Union League,
with its Romanesque front of cinnamon brick
and brownstone on a semi-square, is near the
south end of Bedford Avenue. Its location is
fine, and during the political campaigns it is
an important centre. Medallions of Grant
and Lincoln adorn the front, an eagle with outstretched
wings holds up a 'bay,' and a carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
bear stands on the roof, a symbol of the 'grip'
that clubdom has on the modern man. The
great hall in this house is one of the finest in
the country. Across the city, a square below
the Park plaza, stands the Montauk, a fine
structure, ornate, in light tones of brick, and
with a Greek frieze above the third story,
which is unique in architectural decoration
and is a replica of old bas-reliefs. Near by is
the mammoth building of the Riding and
Driving Club, the largest and best arranged
structure of the kind in this country. The
Hamilton, one of the older clubs, has a tall
building on the corner of Clinton and Remsen
streets, showing an expanse of red brick and
brownstone. It has no distinctive architectural
style. Architecturally, a most elaborate
club-house is the Germania on Schermerhorn
Street. Its style is a rich but modified Florentine.
The material is pale brown brick. A
feature of it is the great arched doorway. The
Bush wick Democratic club-house on Bushwick
Avenue is, architecturally, on the same
lines, a reduced version in stone and terra
cotta. The club has but recently taken possession
of this new house. Out in Flatbush,
on the avenue, is the Midwood, an old colonial
manse, unaltered, with wide-spreading grounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
its façade marked by great white columns,
such as are almost unknown elsewhere in the
county of Kings to-day. The Hanover, on
Bedford Avenue, is a fine modern double
house, with extensions and remodelings. The
Brooklyn and the Oxford clubs have recently
enlarged their rather unpretentious buildings
without special reference to architectural
beauty. The Excelsior is a plain city house.
The Lincoln has the appearance of several
buildings joined together, but is ornate and
striking. Out of town the Crescent and the
Field and Marine clubs have charming
country homes, turreted and porticoed, and
surrounded with trees and <span class="locked">lawns."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>In literary, artistic, musical, dramatic, and
social clubs, the city has become populous.
The Academy of Music had its origin in the
success of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Society,
the leading organization for the patronage of
music, which was incorporated in 1857. It
had been remarked that the audiences which
patronized the concerts of the New York Philharmonic
Society were, in a great part, made
up of Brooklyn people. In 1856 or 1857 it
occurred to the heads of several families, who
were the best and most appreciative patrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the New York society, that Brooklyn might
and ought to have a Philharmonic Society of
its own. The project was inaugurated, and
was attended with success. The subscription
list doubled the second season. There were,
the second year, over seven hundred subscribers,
and numerous patrons besides. The
Athenæum was entirely inadequate for the
purposes of the society. In 1858, the leading
members of the Philharmonic Society, by circulars,
called the attention of several leading
citizens to the relative change that was going
on between the two cities, and pointed to the
success of their society as the best evidence
that the time had come when a large lyric hall
was demanded by the necessities of our city.
About fifty gentlemen responded to this call,
and a preliminary meeting was held at the
Polytechnic Institute, in October, <span class="locked">1858.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> A
public meeting followed, a popular stock company
was formed, and the Academy was incorporated
in 1859. Land in Montague Street
was bought for $41,000. The total expenditure
reached $200,000. The Academy became
and has remained the city's leading
opera house, and largest place of public meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Most of the greatest musical artists,
actors, and orators in the country have been
heard under its roof.</p>

<p>Among the leading musical associations of
the city are the Apollo Club, the Seidl Society,
the Brooklyn Choral Society, the Arion
Society, the Brooklyn Maennerchor, the Zoellner
Maennerchor, the Amphion Musical Society,
the Cæcilia Ladies' Vocal Society, the
Concordia Maennerchor, the Euterpe Chorus
and Orchestra, the Deutscher Liederkranz,
the Saengerbund, and the Prospect Heights
Choral Society. In recent years there has appeared
a disposition to regard Brooklyn as a
musical city. The increase in the number of
musical societies and the patronage of opera
and concert have unquestionably been great.
Among the musical composers, resident in the
city, who have made national reputations,
Dudley Buck has been of first prominence.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Art Association, a development
of the Sketch Club, formed by Brooklyn
artists in 1857, erected a handsome building
adjoining the Academy of Music in 1872.
The exhibitions held in the association galleries
have been the chief displays of pictures
seen within the city. In recent years the
Brooklyn Art Club, a society composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
artists solely, has attained a large membership,
and has exhibited annually in the Art Association
galleries. The Art Association maintains
a free art school. The leading society
of art connoisseurs is the Rembrandt Club.</p>

<p>The Society of Old Brooklynites, the Franklin
Literary Society, and the Bryant Literary
Society have won prominence, and a position
of influence has been assumed by the Brooklyn
Woman's Club.</p>

<p>In private libraries and art collections Brooklyn
has grown rich within the past twenty-five
years. The development of certain valuable
picture collections has induced the wish that
the city had a great museum similar to the
Metropolitan in New York, which might receive
contributions by bequest. The advancement
of the Brooklyn Institute promises to
supply this need.</p>

<p>The newspapers of Brooklyn have acquired
an increasingly influential position in the life
of the city. We have seen how the "Eagle,"
the "Times," and the "Freie Presse" attained
their established positions. The "Standard-Union"
represents some interesting newspaper
history. The "Union" was started in the
midst of the war period, its first editor being
Edward Cary. The paper was purchased in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
1870 by Henry C. Bowen, and Gen. Stewart
L. Woodford became editor-in-chief, and
H.&nbsp;E. Bowen (son of Henry C.), the publisher.
When General Woodford retired a few months
later, he was succeeded by Theodore Tilton,
whose skillful pen was in the service of the
paper until January, 1872, when Henry C.
Bowen assumed the editorship. In the following
year the control of the paper passed to
Benjamin F. Tracy, F.&nbsp;A. Schroeder, John F.
Henry, and others associated with them, and
Robert Burch, who afterward became managing
editor of the "Eagle," took the post of
editor-in-chief. Later the property came into
the hands of Lorin Palmer, and in 1877 the
purchase of the name and good-will of the
Brooklyn "Argus," which had been established
as a weekly in 1866 and as a daily in 1873,
resulted in the change of title to "Union-Argus."
When the Union Publishing Company
was formed, the name "Argus" was
dropped, and the paper was again known as
the "Union" during the aggressive editorship
of John Foord, formerly of the New York
"Times," and afterward editor of "Harper's
Weekly." In 1887 the "Standard," which
had been established in 1884, was consolidated
with the "Union," and John A. Hatton assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the editorship of the "Standard-Union."
Soon afterward William Berri became principal
owner of the paper, and in 1890 Murat
Halstead, long the master spirit of Ohio journalism,
was called to the chair of editor-in-chief.
The qualities which gave Halstead a
national reputation while editor of the Cincinnati
"Commercial Gazette" have not failed to
make his pen a power in Brooklyn and
throughout the State.</p>

<p>The "Citizen," established in 1886 by leading
Democrats of the city, since has been a
forceful and consistent organ of the local
Democracy. The editorship of Andrew McLean
has been one of eloquence and energy,
uniting a consummate knowledge of Brooklyn
with a rare sagacity in estimating men and
affairs.</p>

<p>The establishment of "Brooklyn Life" by
Frederick Mitchell Munroe and John Angus
McKay was a felicitous stroke in Brooklyn
journalism. "Life" has enjoyed a unique
popularity as a weekly review of Brooklyn
social, artistic, and literary affairs.</p>

<p>Brooklyn journalism has been quick to reflect
the life and sentiment of the city. It has
been energetic, original, and clean. The fact
that only two of the newspapers, the "Eagle"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and the "Citizen," publish Sunday editions, is
one which of itself indicates the presence of a
conservative element in the city. The establishment
of Travelers' Bureaus by the "Eagle,"
under the direction of the assistant business
manager, Herbert F. Gunnison, was a piece
of characteristic enterprise.</p>

<p>The political complexion of Brooklyn and
Kings County during the past two or three
decades has become increasingly Democratic,
with periodical Republican relapses. In the
incumbency of the sheriff's office, for example,
there has been an interesting alternation in parties
since 1875. During the same period the
two parties have been represented with approximate
evenness in the Mayor's office. In leadership
of the Democratic party Henry C.
Murphy was succeeded by his energetic lieutenant,
Hugh McLaughlin, who has retained
the position at the head of the party since before
the Rebellion. The period and completeness
of this local leadership probably finds no
parallel in American political history. No
analogous situation has ever existed in the
Republican party, which has never had a generally
recognized leader, and whose successes
at the polls have been those of a party or a
public feeling in opposition to the dominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
organized party. Both independent Democratic
and independent Republican movements
and leaderships have played an important part
in the later activities of political life.</p>

<p>Of the commercial development of Brooklyn
since 1876, it is to be said that it has advanced
more remarkably on the water front than elsewhere.
The traffic in grain, sugar, and oil,
with the extensive cooperage and ship-building
and repairing operations, constitutes an important
element in any estimate of the city's prominence
in manufactures.</p>

<p>In the value of <span class="locked">products<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> the sugar industry
stands first, the foundry and machine-shop
interests coming second, and slaughtering and
meat-packing third. Fourth and fifth positions
are to be given respectively to chemical industries
and the grinding of coffee and spices.
Cordage and twine making has for a long time
occupied a prominent place in Brooklyn.
Other prominent industries are in boots and
shoes, furnishing goods, and paper hangings.
The National Meter Company plant in South
Brooklyn is the largest in the world.</p>

<p>One of the most striking illustrations of
Brooklyn's advancement in commercial affairs
has been the increase in the number and importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of its financial institutions. The
city's first banks were the Long Island <span class="locked">Bank,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
incorporated in 1824; the Brooklyn Savings
Bank, incorporated in 1827; the Atlantic
Bank, incorporated in 1836; the Bank of Williamsburgh,
incorporated in 1839; the South
Brooklyn Savings Bank, incorporated in 1850;
and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, incorporated
in 1851. The first fire insurance
company (the Brooklyn) was contemporaneous
with the first bank. The Long Island Insurance
Company was organized in 1833. In
1893 four insurance companies had their home
offices in Brooklyn; there were twenty-three
banks of deposit, fourteen savings banks, four
safe deposit companies, seven trust companies,
four title guarantee companies, and four savings
institutions. In the same year there were
about one hundred and ten strictly local securities.</p>

<h3>I<br />

FRANCIS <span class="locked">LEWIS<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></h3>

<p>One of the names ever to be remembered in the history
of Brooklyn, and of the State and country, is that of
Francis Lewis, who was an ardent patriot, and sacrificed
his all to secure the independence of the colonies. As
he resided for more than twenty years on Long Island,
he can justly be claimed as one of her sons, and as such
richly deserves a place in her history. Few men displayed
so much zeal in the cause of liberty, or evinced
such readiness to endure the hardships which the struggle
necessarily entailed.</p>

<p>His career covered a period of fourscore years and
ten. He spent sixty-eight of these years in the New
Netherlands,&mdash;forty-one of them under the rule of England;
seven years in the cause of the Revolution; and
twenty years as a citizen of the Republic of the United
States, upon whose banner he ever looked with pleasure
and delight.</p>

<p>Born amidst the wilds of rocky Wales, in the town of
Llandaff, in 1713, he possessed the sturdy endurance
and perseverance for which the ancient Britons, from
whom he was descended, were proverbial. In such a
clime, and under such circumstances, he early learned to
bear patiently the privations of life, and thus was fitted
and prepared for the great work which characterized his
eventful career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
His father, the Rev. William Lewis, was a worthy
minister of the Established Church of England, and his
mother was the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Pettingill, a
clergyman of the same faith, whose parish was in the
north of Wales. Young Lewis did not long enjoy a
parent's care, being left an orphan at the early age of
four or five. His education and training were now committed
to a maternal aunt, who ever manifested a deep
interest in his welfare. This relative and adopted mother
took particular pains to have him thoroughly instructed
in his native language, and instilled into him those deep
religious principles, which formed a marked and striking
phase of his character. Not satisfied with the means
of education to be obtained in his mountain home, she
sent her ward to Scotland to visit some relatives in
the Highlands, amongst whom he soon acquired a perfect
familiarity with the Gaelic tongue. Remaining in
Scotland a short time, he was transferred to the care of
an uncle, who held the position of Dean of St. Paul's in
London. The Dean at once gave him the advantages of
the celebrated school at Westminster. The opportunities
thus afforded were embraced and appreciated. By his
assiduity and proficiency he soon won a distinguished
place as a scholar. His progress was rapid, and when
he left the school he had obtained a complete classical
education.</p>

<p>On leaving school the natural bent of his mind appeared
to be for commercial pursuits. In order to prepare
him for the path he had chosen, he was apprenticed
to a merchant in London.</p>

<p>When Lewis reached manhood he came into possession
of the little fortune left by his father, and thereupon resolved
to engage in ventures on his own account. Perceiving
that the old world did not present a suitable field
of operation for a young man with a small capital, he
anticipated the advice of the Sage of Chappaqua, and
determined to seek his fortune in the new and promising
western world. Collecting his effects together, he converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
them into money, which he invested in such articles
of merchandise as he thought marketable, and, with
his stock in trade, sailed for New York, where he arrived
in the spring of 1735. He was disappointed in finding
that his stock of goods could not be sold in New York,
by reason of the limited demand. A man of his energy
was ready to overcome all difficulties. In the emergency
he entered into a partnership with Edward
Annesly, with whom he left a portion of his goods for
sale, shipping the remainder to Philadelphia, whither he
himself went to superintend their disposal. In the latter
city he remained two years, and then returned to New
York. Once more in New Amsterdam, he entered into
business, becoming extensively engaged in foreign trade.
While thus employed, and on June 15, 1745, realizing
the truth of Scripture "that it is not good for man to be
alone," he entered the holy and sacred relation of marriage
with Miss Elizabeth Annesly, his partner's sister.
The issue of this marriage was seven children, three only
of whom survived infancy. One of his sons, Morgan
Lewis, greatly distinguished himself, subsequently becoming
governor of the State of New York.</p>

<p>During the remarkably severe winter of 1741 Lewis
drove his horse and sleigh from New York to Barnstable,
the entire length of Long Island Sound, on the ice.
This must have been an interesting episode in his life.
Referring to the intensity of the cold season, the "Boston
Post" of January 12, 1741, says: "For these three weeks
we have had a continued series of extreme cold weather,
so that our harbors and rivers are continually frozen up.
On Charles River a tent is erected for the entertainment
of travellers. From Point Alderton, along the South
Shore, the ice is continued for the space of above 20
miles."</p>

<p>The Boston "News Letter" of March 5, 1741, contains
the statement that "people ride every day from
Stratford, Conn., to Long Island, which is three leagues
across, which was never known before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
It appears that the temperature did not moderate with
the appearance of spring, as the same paper, on April 2,
again alludes to the subject, saying, "that people from
Thompson Island, Squantum, and the adjacent neighborhood
have come fifteen Sabbaths successively upon the
ice to our meeting."</p>

<p>Francis Lewis being an active and industrious man,
his business often required his presence abroad, and led
him to travel extensively in Europe. At various times
he visited Russia, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and
on two occasions endured the terror and discomfort of
shipwreck on the coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>On his return from the old world he found the affairs
of the colony in a very unsettled condition. The French
war was engaging the attention of the people. During a
short period he was employed as agent to supply the wants
of the British troops. The romance of his life was now
about to commence. In the performance of his duties, he
was present in August, 1756, when Fort Oswego was reduced,
and compelled to surrender to the French General
de Montcalm. The fort at this time was commanded
by Colonel Mersey, one of his warm personal friends.
In the emergency attending the bombardment, Lewis, to
serve his friend, acted as his aid. Montcalm on the 10th
of August approached the fort at the head of a mixed
array of 5000 men, consisting of Europeans, Canadians,
and Indians. The garrison having used up all their ammunition,
Mersey spiked the cannon, and crossed the
river to Little Oswego, without the loss of a single man.
Montcalm at once took possession of the deserted fort,
and immediately began a heavy fire, which was kept up
without intermission. The next day Mersey was killed
by a shot while standing by the side of Lewis. The
commander having fallen, the garrison at once capitulated,
surrendering themselves prisoners of war. It consisted
of 1400 men, composing three regiments, one of
which was the Jersey Blues, under Col. Peter Schuyler.
By the terms of the surrender they were to be exempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from plunder, taken to Montreal, and treated with
humanity. The French, however, did not regard the
promise which they had made. When the surrender was
effected, Montcalm soon forgot his pledge, and shamefully
allowed one of the Indian warriors to select thirty
of the prisoners to treat as he pleased. Lewis was one
of the number chosen, and naturally expected a speedy
and cruel death. He was, however, saved in a most unexpected
manner. The family tradition on the subject,
handed down by his son, and communicated to the writer
by a gentleman of this city, who received it from Governor
Morgan Lewis himself, is that Francis Lewis soon
ascertained that he understood their dialect, and could
freely converse with them, so that they comprehended
what he said. His ability to communicate with the Indians
in their own tongue pleased the chieftain, who
extended to him the utmost kindness, and on his arrival
at Montreal sought by every means within his power to
induce the French commander to allow him to return to
his family, without being compelled to pay any ransom.
The request so urgently made was refused. Lewis was
sent as a prisoner of war to France, and upon being exchanged
was permitted to return to America.</p>

<p>The British government, in consideration of the services
he had rendered, gave him a grant of 5000 acres of
land, but as the fees amounted to more than the land
was worth he never took out the necessary patent, the
warrant for which was left in the Secretary of State's
office.</p>

<p>Many have looked upon this tradition concerning
Francis Lewis as mythical. Had it been false, a man of
his sterling qualities would have contradicted the statements
published during his lifetime. Some have supposed
that he gathered more or less knowledge of the
Indian dialect through business intercourse. It presents
a very interesting feature in American history, opening
up as it does a wide field for research. As it deserves
more than a passing notice, it will not be out of place to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
turn aside for a moment, and consider how it was that
Francis Lewis understood the Indian warrior.</p>

<p>It frequently has been claimed that Madoc, a Welshman,
made voyages to America, long before Columbus
was born. It has been conceded by many authorities
that Prince Madoc, a Welsh navigator, upon the death of
his father resolved to seek a new home, and thereby
avoid contention with his brothers and relatives as to the
succession. This was about the year 1170. He prepared
his ships and munitions of war, and sailing westward
came to a country theretofore unknown. Upon his
return to his native land he gave a glowing account of
the richness and beauty of the land he had visited. Restless
in spirit, he could not long remain satisfied with the
crags of Cambria, and prepared a fleet of ten sails, once
more bent his course westward, and was never heard of
again. There are many curious evidences that in early
times Welsh tribes of Indians, or Indians speaking the
Welsh language, were to be found on the continent of
America.</p>

<p>Dr. John Williams published in London, in 1791, a very
interesting inquiry into the truth concerning the discovery
of America by Prince Madoc. In his treatise
much valuable information is to be found, and many
strong arguments in favor of the claim that the Welsh
settled America more than 300 years anterior to the discovery
by Columbus. Dr. Williams refers to the Lewis
incident, and published his book twelve years before the
death of Francis Lewis.</p>

<p>To return from our digression, Francis Lewis could not
be idle. On his return from his enforced trip to France,
we find him once again engaged in business. He was a
man in advance of his time, and well knew the value of
newspaper advertisements. The following is a copy of
one of his announcements, published in the "New York
Gazette and Weekly Post Boy," the leading journal of
the <span class="locked">day:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Just imported and to be sold by Francis Lewis in the Fly,
Alamodes, Lutestrings, Ducapes, Damasks, Mantua Silks, Grazettes,
Padajoy's Velvets, India Taffities, Groganes, Sewing
Silks, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>The commercial trips taken by Lewis gave him an
enlarged view of men and things. In Europe he had witnessed
the aggressions of the rich landed proprietors
upon the poorer classes, and the untold wrongs perpetrated
upon the white slaves of the mines and manufacturing
towns. His natural, inherent sense of right led
him to endorse and freely proclaim the doctrine, "that
all men are born free and equal." Wherever he went he
beheld the outrages which the assumed leaders imposed
upon the common people. He saw how utterly powerless
they were to remove the burdens and restrictions which
stood in the way of their advancement. Everywhere he
found power trampling upon human rights. In him the
downtrodden and oppressed ever found a faithful friend
and helper. As he always kept his eyes and ears open,
he was prepared with force and vigor to oppose the encroachments
of the British Crown upon the rights of the
people. Looking upon America as the home of the oppressed,
with whom he always sympathized, he at once
became greatly attached to his adopted country.</p>

<p>Watching with close scrutiny every act of the mother
country, he early foresaw that the demands of Great Britain
would eventually result in a rupture.</p>

<p>George II. died October 25, 1760, and was succeeded
by his grandson, George III., a young man of twenty-two
years of age. Shortly after his accession, and on the
18th of November, 1761, Lieutenant-Governor Cadwallader
Colden assumed control of affairs in the colony of
New York, during the temporary absence of Governor
Monckton. Governor Monckton returned after capturing
the island of Martinique in June, 1762, and remained in
office until June, 1763, when he returned to his native
land, again leaving the management of affairs in the
hands of Lieutenant-Governor Colden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
During Monckton's career, it may be said that the principles
of liberty were first invaded by an assault upon the
independence of the judiciary by the board of trade.
Justice Pratt was appointed chief justice in the place of
De Lancey. The board of trade declared that he should
hold office during the pleasure of the King, and not during
good behavior, as had always been the rule. Such a
declaration and assumption gave the King power to remove
for political reasons any judge in the land, thus
making the judge but a tool of the King, and depriving
him of that independence which could alone render his
decisions entitled to respect. The people naturally looked
upon this action as an invasion of their civil rights, and
calculated to destroy the confidence of the community in
the expounders of the law. To their credit be it said
that both Monckton and Colden boldly opposed the measure.</p>

<p>The Provincial Assembly looked upon the conditions
imposed relative to the appointment of the chief justice
with detestation. They opposed it bitterly, manifesting
their opposition by absolutely refusing to make any provision
for the payment of his salary until he received a
commission, which would place him above and beyond
legislative political control. The board of trade refused
to surrender, or in any wise alter the conditions they had
adopted. As the Assembly would make no provision for
his salary, it was suggested that the royal quit-rents
should be applied to the object. The plan was adopted,
and thus the judiciary passed under the control of the sovereign,
and the death knell of its independence was
sounded.</p>

<p>Colden was destined to wield the reins of government
during an important and trying time. The storm cloud
could be seen gradually rising. At first appearing no
larger than a man's hand, it slowly increased until at last
the black and heavy clouds seemed ready to break forth
at any moment with devastating fury. Everything looked
dark and gloomy, and betokened the approaching storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
The mutterings of the people grew louder and more
threatening. The government did not heed them, but
made their demands more arrogant, seeming to take the
Egyptian taskmasters as their guide. Parliament acted
as if they considered the colonies fit subjects for plunder.</p>

<p>In 1763 the subject of taxing the colonies was brought
up in Parliament, and a measure introduced for its imposition.
This was antagonized by the Provincial Assembly
of New York, and denounced as arrogant and illegal.</p>

<p>Lord Grenville was the chancellor of the English exchequer.
To him belongs the credit of suggesting the
proposition of raising a revenue by a direct tax upon the
colonies. He, then, was the initiator of the abuses
which led to the independence of the people.</p>

<p>Lord Grenville understood human nature, and therefore
resolved to accomplish his purpose by degrees. He
sought to gradually obtain entire control over the finances
and resources of the colonies, take from the people their
liberties, and render them merely subservient vassals of
the Crown. He proposed as an entering wedge that a
tax should be imposed upon foreign productions, and that
stamp duties should be created. As such measures were
always unpopular, he saw at once that men and means
would have to be provided for the collection of the duties.
He well knew that the people would not tamely submit
to the enforcement of such burdens. In order to carry
the law into effect, he proposed the creation of an army
of 10,000 men, believing that such a force would act upon
the fears of the subjects, and compel them to submit
quietly to the great wrong.</p>

<p>The thunderings of discontent grew louder and louder;
and the murmurs resounded on every side. Grenville
became prime minister in 1764, and by reason of his
elevation exerted a great and controlling influence over
Parliament. He was now in a position to successfully
carry out the schemes he had proposed the year before.
Upon assuming his new position, next to the Crown itself,
he forcibly urged upon Parliament his peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
methods to raise revenue. He contended that the home
government had the right to impose such duties and
taxes as they thought proper, without consulting the
wishes of the colonists. An act was passed in accordance
with his views, providing a tax upon various articles,
which formerly had been admitted free of duty.</p>

<p>The Provincial Assembly of the colony of New York
protested against these tyrannical acts, and forwarded a
strong and forcible memorial to the ministry. The manliness
manifested by the Assembly in thus declaring its
rights brought down upon them the animosity of the
Crown; led to the suspension of their legislative prerogatives,
thereby depriving the people of representation in
the affairs of the colony. New York was not the only
province that sent protests. While the Assembly of New
York spoke boldly and fearlessly, the sister colonies were
more suppliant. If the other colonies had displayed the
same determination to oppose the inroads upon their
rights as New York evinced, it would have resulted at
the outset in a repeal of the odious measures.</p>

<p>The Stamp Act was passed on the 22d of March, 1765,
to take effect on the 1st of November ensuing. The
colonial Governor Colden declared that he would enforce
the law. This enunciation did not terrify the people, as
a fixed resolve permeated the masses to oppose its enforcement
at all hazards. Citizens obtained copies of
the act, and in broad daylight hawked them about the
street with a death's head bearing the inscription, "The
Folly of England and the Ruin of America." Meetings,
public and private, were held throughout the city, and in
the outlying sections of the colony. The subject was
earnestly discussed on the streets and in all places of
public resort. Lewis was amongst the first to refuse
submission to or acquiescence in the royal demands.
Love of liberty and justice induced him to enlist in the
cause of the patriots against the enactments of Parliament.
This was the grand principle which induced him
to unite with the devoted band which sprang into existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and was known as the "Sons of Liberty." The
avowed object of this noble company was to concert and
adopt measures whereby the exercise of an undue power
by the mother country might be defeated.</p>

<p>When the Provincial Assembly of New York, apprehending
danger, and realizing the necessity of united
action on the part of all the colonies, deemed it wise
and prudent to recommend a congress of delegates to
assemble in New York on the 7th of October, 1765, to
consider what action should be taken to oppose the
repulsive Stamp Act, Mr. Lewis was elected to represent
New York as a delegate, and when they met took his
seat in the convention. His head, heart, and soul were
enlisted in the cause, and he earnestly advocated the
adoption of the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>He was one of the men selected to circulate the principles
of the Sons of Liberty, and seek the formation of
similar societies throughout the colonies. In this grand
work he was associated with Isaac Sears, Marrinus
Willett, Gershom Mott, Hugh Hughes, William Wiley,
Thomas Robinson, Flores Bancker, and Edward Laight,
all of whom were tried patriots, whose deeds of daring
and earnest labors will live in the memory of a grateful
people while time shall last. Truly have they "left behind
them footprints on the sands of time," and "their
actions smell sweet and blossom in their dust."</p>

<p>At this time Francis Lewis resided at Whitestone,
L.&nbsp;I., having removed with his family to his country home
early in 1765. His residence in Queens County did not
prevent his acting with the Sons of Liberty. In those
days many of the prominent officials lived in Brooklyn
and on the Island.</p>

<p>The appointment of this committee resulted in the
selection of a correspondent in London, who kept the
patriots informed as to the projected movements of
the British authorities, by which means they were enabled
to adopt measures to thwart the purposes of the Crown.
The information received from time to time led to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
desire for a closer union of the colonies. The old Dutch
maxim, which has been preserved and adopted as part of
the seal of our good city of Brooklyn, "In union is
strength," was uppermost in their minds, and induced
them to invite the respective colonies to send delegates
to a congress to assemble in New York on the 7th of
October, 1765.</p>

<p>Some New England writers have given the credit of
the formation of this congress to Massachusetts. This
is an unhistorical assumption. Whilst New England
men did yeoman service in the cause, they did not enlist
in it until they had been spurred on by the "Sons of
Liberty" of New York. This congress of delegates owed
its existence to the persistency of New Yorkers, and was
by them first called together.</p>

<p>The congress was organized by the election of Timothy
Ruggles, of Massachusetts, as president. The session
lasted for three weeks. The measures introduced
and the work accomplished were mainly initiated by the
delegates from New York. A declaration of rights, prepared
and submitted by John Cruger, Mayor of New
York, was adopted; and a memorial and statement of
grievances for presentation to Parliament was prepared
and introduced by Robert R. Livingston, also of New
York. Livingston subsequently was a member of the
Continental Congress, and associated with Jefferson on
the committee appointed to draft the Declaration of
Independence. Livingston's address to Parliament was
signed by nearly all the members. The declaration of
rights was a vigorous and forcible document. It announced
the grand principle that "taxation without
representation is tyranny," and declared that as the
colonies were so remote as to preclude representation in
Parliament, the right of taxation only vested in the legislative
authorities. It boldly denounced the Stamp Act
as tyrannical, and demanded its repeal.</p>

<p>Prior to the assembling of this congress a committee
waited upon Governor Colden to solicit his aid and encouragement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
As Colden had in former times advocated
the rights of the people, it was but natural to expect
encouragement and support from him in this trying hour.
The committee was disappointed. To their infinite
surprise and disgust he declared the congress to be
"unconstitutional, unprecedented, and unlawful," and
announced that he should give it no countenance.</p>

<p>It is within the bounds of reason to say that Jefferson,
in the production of his inimitable paper, caught his
inspiration from these noble documents emanating from
the Dutchmen of New York, and so readily endorsed by
their associates in this congress. The doctrine brought
over in the Mayflower led for a time to proscription,
whilst the lesson taught by the Dutch settlers was freedom
and toleration. The forefathers of New England
who sought the New World to enjoy religious liberty
refused to grant the same privilege to others. The
Dutch, on the other hand, extended a welcome to the
Pilgrims, gave them a home at Delft Haven for eleven
years, afforded an asylum to the persecuted Quakers
who fled from New England, and always exercised the
precept enunciated at a later day by the martyr Lincoln,
"with malice toward none, with charity for all."</p>

<p>The acts and enunciations of the congress were approved
by the people, and adopted by the Colonial
Assembly which met in November. Shortly after the
ratification of the petitions by the Colonial Assembly,
Governor Colden wrote to the home government that
"whatever happens in this place has the greatest influence
on the other colonies. They have their eyes perpetually
on it, and they govern themselves accordingly."</p>

<p>The Stamp Act was to take effect on the 1st of November,
1765. The merchants on the eve of the 1st
were greatly excited. With one accord, they congregated
at Burns's Coffee House, near the Battery, and with
united voice passed the following resolution: "To import
no goods from England until the Stamp Act be repealed;
to countermand all orders already sent for spring goods;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to sell no goods from England on commission; to abide
by these resolutions until they should be rescinded by a
general meeting called for that purpose."</p>

<p>The Sons of Liberty, in order to carry on their work
so well commenced, appointed from their number a
committee of five, which was termed the non-importation
committee, whose duty it was to enter into correspondence
with the other colonies, and, by enlisting their sympathy,
induce them to coöperate in the work, and adopt
a similar policy.</p>

<p>The stamps reached New York October 29, 1765. In
order to protect them from the rage of the people, they
were placed on board of a British man-of-war, in the harbor.
Governor Colden declared that he could not be intimidated;
that the stamps should be delivered in due time.
The Governor was in a dilemma, as neither threats nor
persuasion could induce the people to aid or assist in the
removal.</p>

<p>The 1st of November came. Business was entirely
suspended. Every heart was burdened with anxiety.
The flags on the shipping were placed at half-mast, and
the church bells tolled mournfully. Many private residences
displayed the insignia of mourning. On every
side it appeared as if a great and dire calamity had visited
the colony. Handbills denouncing the administration
appeared in public places as if by magic, and the
people were warned not to give in their adhesion to the
Crown by purchasing the condemned stamps. Activity
marked the rank and file of the Sons of Liberty. During
the day they bent their energies in making preparations
for an evening display. Shortly after dark they assembled
and proceeded to the Commons, in the neighborhood
of the present City Hall, where a gallows was quickly
erected, and an effigy of Governor Colden suspended
therefrom. A piece of stamped paper was placed in his
hand, a drum at his back, and a placard on his breast
with the inscription, "To the Rebel Drummer of 1745."
Another company carried a life-sized figure of Colden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
seated in a chair, through the streets to the Fort. When
they reached Colden's residence they broke open his
stable, took therefrom his coach of state, placed the
image in the coach, and with it returned and joined their
companions in the park. With them they formed into
line, and once again proceeded to the Fort and demanded
admission. At this time the Fort was under the command
of General Gage, who wisely withheld his fire, well knowing
that the first shot would madden and infuriate the
populace. As admission to the Fort was refused, the
citizens repaired to the Bowling Green, kindled a fire,
and placed thereon the Governor's coach, image, and the
effigy which had been suspended on the gallows. The
Sons of Liberty could not hold the people in check. The
residence of James, one of the Crown officers, was visited,
and because he had advocated the Stamp Act his house
was reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>The excitement did not abate. Colden well knew that
his successor was expected daily, and he was anxious to
lift the responsibility from his own shoulders, and place
it on those of his successor. This proffer on the part of
Colden did not satisfy the people; they wanted the entire
control of the stamps themselves. Again the Sons of
Liberty assembled, fully equipped, resolved to obtain the
stamps at all hazards, and, if needs be, storm the Fort itself.
The Governor became alarmed, and agreed to deliver
them to the Mayor and Corporation. The stamps
were thereupon transferred to John Cruger, the Mayor,
who gave a receipt on behalf of the city, "to take charge,
and care of, and be accountable in case they shall be destroyed
or carried out of the province." The Sons of
Liberty, satisfied with the results of their labors, quietly
dispersed. This was the 5th of November. Peace and
quietude once again reigned.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Moore, the new Governor, arrived November
13, 1765, and wisely declared at the outset that he
would have nothing to do with the detested stamps, and
directed that those he had brought with him should be
deposited with the others in the City Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
The spirit of hatred to the Stamp Act, manifested in
the province of New York, proved contagious. The
colony of Maryland caught the infection, and drove from
her midst a stamp agent, who sought a refuge on Long
Island. Hither the Sons of Liberty followed him, and
compelled him to resign his office, under the solemnity
of an oath. This act on the part of the Sons of Liberty
was greatly appreciated by the inhabitants of Maryland.</p>

<p>The spirit displayed by the inhabitants of New York
continued to spread, until at last the different colonies
became one in spirit. Parliament saw it would be useless
to attempt the enforcement of the Stamp Act, and
repealed it February 20, 1766. The news reached New
York March 20, 1766, filling the community with untold
joy. A dinner was given, and a liberty pole erected,
bearing the inscription, "The King, Pitt, and Liberty."
This pole was destined to become the rallying-spot of
the Sons of Liberty.</p>

<p>Peace did not last long. In 1767, the chancellor of
the exchequer introduced and secured the passage of
a bill, imposing duties on all tea, glass, paper, painters'
colors, and lead, imported into the colony. This measure
was looked upon as a fresh invasion of their rights by
the inhabitants, and a new burst of feeling appeared.</p>

<p>In 1768 a new Assembly was convened. Kings County
was represented by Simon Boerum, John Rapalje, and
Abraham Schenck. At the opening of the session in
October, a correspondence was entered into with the
colony of Massachusetts, responsive to a circular sent by
that colony, asking their aid, sympathy, and coöperation
in securing a removal of common grievances. In unmistakable
terms the Assembly denounced the outrages.
The public prints were equally emphatic. The boldness
of the Assembly led to its dissolution, and a new one in
the interest of the Crown was convened in 1769. The
new body catered to the Royalists, passing resolutions
in the interest of the Crown, thereby exciting the Sons
of Liberty to renewed efforts. In December, 1769, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
patriots again circulated handbills, denouncing the Assembly
as base betrayers of the sacred trust reposed in
them. The Assembly received no consideration at the
hands of the malcontents.</p>

<p>In January, 1770, the Royalist soldiers, to show contempt
for the citizens of the city, attempted to destroy
the liberty pole. They even, in their fury at the failure
of the effort, broke into the building occupied by the
Sons of Liberty, and destroyed its windows and furniture.
During several nights in succession the soldiers renewed
their endeavors to destroy the emblem of liberty. At
last they succeeded, manifesting their spite by cutting it
in small pieces, which they placed in front of the headquarters
of the patriots. The insult was understood, and
fresh conflicts arose, the soldiers and the people finally
coming into violent collision in the so-called battle of
Golden Hill.</p>

<p>Early in 1770 Parliament repealed all the duties except
that on tea.</p>

<p>In 1771 Francis Lewis removed his family to New
York, and entered into business with his son. This connection
did not last long. The political atmosphere was
surcharged with dissatisfaction. The storm cloud of dissension
still hung threateningly, and the future looked
black and dismal. In such a state of affairs his course
was not doubtful.</p>

<p>The English authorities resolved to enforce the duty
on tea. The vessels containing it sailed from England
October 26, 1773. The events that followed are familiar
in American history.</p>

<p>The New York "tea party" was a greater success
than the one in Boston, as the New Yorkers not only
threw the tea overboard, but also confiscated one of the
vessels, and sent the captains of both back in the other
craft, disheartened and crestfallen.</p>

<p>On the 22d of April, 1775, Lewis, having relinquished
business, was elected by a convention of delegates from
Kings, Queens, New York, and the other counties, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
represent the province in the Continental Congress to
assemble in Philadelphia. At this time Lewis lived on
Long Island. The colony had two governors. Tryon
represented the Crown and the Royalists, and General
Nathaniel Woodhull, of Suffolk County, was president pro
tem. of the Provincial Council, possessing the functions
of a governor. Antagonism existed between the two.
The Provincial Council directed the guns to be removed
from the Battery. This was opposed by Tryon. On the
23d of August, 1775, the committee proceeded to discharge
the duty assigned them. The British ship Asia
was in the harbor, having just arrived from Boston, and
by direction of Tryon at once opened her broadside.
Morgan Lewis, son of Francis Lewis, during his lifetime
stated that at this time the first ball shot from an English
ship, during the war, struck his father's house on
the Long Island shore, shattering the beam under his
mother's foot. The family were greatly terrified, and
hastily sought a refuge in the neighboring hills.</p>

<p>The Provincial Congress met in New York in December,
1775. Francis Lewis was continued a delegate to
the Continental Congress for 1776. His appears as
one of the immortal fifty-six names appended to the
Declaration of Independence. On that occasion, in the
impetuosity of his enthusiasm, he exclaimed: "Now we
must hang together or we shall hang separately."</p>

<p>The convention of representatives of the State of New
York, which met at White Plains, July 9, 1776, unanimously
ratified the acts of their delegates. Two of the
signers of the Declaration from New York, to wit, Francis
Lewis and William Floyd, were residents of Long Island.
It will thus be seen that our island sent one half of the
State delegation.</p>

<p>Lewis was now kept busy in political matters. During
several subsequent years he was appointed to represent
the State in national affairs. Whilst in Congress his
advice was often sought, and his prudence and business
tact made him a valuable member. Always maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
a spotless reputation, he secured and retained the confidence
of his associates. Matters which required caution
and discretion were referred to him. Valuable service
was rendered by him in purchasing clothing for the
army, and in importing arms and ammunition. Besides
all this he was frequently employed on committees and
in the secret service of the government.</p>

<p>At the time the Tories occupied New York, and terror
and consternation filled the hearts of all, he, with Messrs.
Sherman and Gerry, was appointed a committee by Congress
to repair to New York, ascertain the condition of
the army, and devise means to supply its wants.</p>

<p>In 1775 Lewis removed his family to his country residence
at Whitestone, L.&nbsp;I. It did not prove wise on his
part, as it was stepping into the hornet's nest. Shortly
after the occupation of the island by General Howe, and
on August 23, 1776, a party of British light horse, under
Colonel Burch, plundered his home, destroyed his library
and valuable papers, and removed such articles as they
could conveniently carry away, leaving him barely sufficient
means with which to pay his debts. At this time
he was sixty-three years old, and by this wanton act was
placed in a truly pitiable condition. They were not satisfied
with the destruction of his property, but thirsted
for vengeance on the man who dared to proclaim himself
a friend of liberty by signing the Declaration of
Independence, which was an indictment by the grand
jury of the people against the tyranny of Great Britain.
The vandal invaders took Mrs. Lewis a prisoner, and retained
her in close confinement several months, without
allowing her either a bed to rest upon or a change of
clothing.</p>

<p>The attention of Congress was directed to her situation
in November, 1776. A resolution was passed to exchange
Mrs. Grace Kempe, wife of John Tabor Kempe,
the Tory attorney-general of New York, whom the
Americans held as a prisoner, for Mrs. Lewis. In the
effort they were unsuccessful. Washington became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
greatly interested in her behalf, and through his instrumentality
she was at last released. She had endured
intense suffering, which impaired her constitution, and
resulted in her death within two years thereafter. She
was buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>About this time Lewis's son Francis was married to a
Miss Ludlow. The Ludlow family strenuously opposed
the match, saying that his father was a notorious rebel
and would certainly be hanged, and they did not want to
be allied to a family whose head was destined to meet
such a fate.</p>

<p>By the terms of the resolution passed by Congress,
October 14, 1777, each State was entitled to a representation
of seven members, and unless two members were in
attendance, the State would have no vote. The cabal
took advantage of the fact that New York had but two
members in town, and, as one of them was sick and unable
to attend, the State would thereby have no vote in
the deliberations of Congress. They determined to raise
the issue in Congress by appointing a committee to arrest
Washington at Valley Forge. Francis Lewis was the
only member from New York capable of taking his seat.
The other member, Col. Wm. Duer, was very sick; but,
loving his country more than his life, immediately upon
learning the necessity of his presence sent for his physician,
and demanded to know whether he could be removed
and taken to the halls of Congress. The doctor
replied, "Yes; but at the expense of your life!" "Do
you mean that I would expire before reaching the place?"
"No; but I would not answer for your life twenty-four
hours afterwards." "Very well, sir," the noble Roman
replied; "you have done your duty, prepare a litter for
me; if you refuse, some one else shall do it; but I prefer
your care in this case." The litter was prepared, and
the patient made ready to sacrifice his life, to defeat the
machinations of the misguided men who sought to degrade
Washington. Fortunately the sacrifice was prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
by the opportune arrival of Gouverneur Morris,
another delegate, who, on reaching the headquarters of
the New York delegation, found Colonel Duer on the
litter, covered with blankets, attended by his physician
and carriers, ready to go to the Court House, where Congress
was to meet. Lewis and Morris being present
gave New York a vote, and forced the evil-minded members
to see that their scheme could not be safely advocated,
and the effort was abandoned.</p>

<p>When Lewis retired from Congress, that body, in consideration
of his services, and remembering his many
sacrifices, appointed him commissioner of the board of
admiralty, which position he accepted. In April, 1784,
Lewis was an earnest worker in the reorganization of the
Chamber of Commerce, which he had been instrumental
in founding, and assisted in procuring its charter, which
passed the Legislature April 13, 1784.</p>

<p>Lewis lived to see the accomplishment of his heart's
desire, and was permitted to live in the infant republic
for which he had spent his time and fortune for a period
of twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>His children followed in his footsteps. One of them,
Francis Lewis, Jr., represented Queens County in the
Assembly of 1788. The other son, Morgan, was born
October 16, 1754, graduated at Princeton College in
1773, studied law with John Jay, and joined the army
under Washington in 1775. At first he was captain of a
rifle company, but rose rapidly, becoming, in 1776, colonel
and chief-of-staff under General Gates. He was at
the battle of Saratoga, and distinguished himself under
General Clinton in the Mohawk Valley. After the war,
he continued his legal studies, and was admitted to the
bar. Soon after he was appointed judge of the court of
common pleas. In 1791 he was elected attorney-general,
as the successor of Aaron Burr, holding the position until
December 24, 1792, when he became a justice of the
Supreme Court. On the 28th of October, 1801, he took
his seat as chief justice of the Supreme Court of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
State of New York. Other honors awaited him. He
was Governor of the State from 1804 to 1807, succeeding
Governor Clinton as the third Governor of the Commonwealth.
At the election, party spirit and feeling were
manifested to a great degree. Aaron Burr was his opponent,
and displayed great anxiety to secure the election.
Although Lewis was a Jeffersonian, he received the warm
support of Alexander Hamilton. It was mainly through
the efforts of Hamilton that his success in the contest
was secured. Hamilton's labors in behalf of Lewis embittered
Burr, and formed one of the main causes which a
few months later led to his untimely end at the hands of
the miscreant intriguer Burr. Burr was a student with
Lewis at Princeton, and graduated in 1772, one year in
advance of the Governor.</p>

<p>On several subsequent occasions, Morgan Lewis was
elected state senator, and also chancellor of the University.
In 1812 he was appointed quartermaster, and became
a major-general in 1813. During that year he was
engaged in operations on the Niagara River, and commanded
the defenses in New York city in 1814. In
1828, when seventy-four years of age, he was elected a
presidential elector for the fifth district of New York.</p>

<p>Lewis Avenue, Brooklyn, was named in his honor.</p>

<p>Morgan Lewis was a man of great scholastic attainments.
The New York Historical Society elected him
their president in 1835. In 1839 he was chosen president
of the Society of the Cincinnati, holding the office until
his death, April 7, 1844. He was the last but one of the
Revolutionary soldiers who filled that position. He was
grand master of the Free Masons at the time of his
death, and was buried by the craft with their impressive
ceremonies. He was married at Clermont on the Hudson
in May, 1779, to Gertrude, the sister of Chancellor
Livingston.</p>

<p>On the 6th of August, 1784, Morgan Lewis purchased
eighty acres of land in Brooklyn, bounded by the Gowanus
Road, and the road leading from Brooklyn to Flatbush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
It was a portion of the estate belonging to John
Rapelje, which became forfeited by his allegiance to the
Tories, and was sold by the commissioners appointed to
sell the property of all who adhered to the Crown.</p>

<p>Francis Lewis, the hero and patriot, spent his last days
in comparative poverty; but his heart was cheered by the
fact that he had given his fortune to his country, and
spent his life in her service.</p>

<p>On the 30th of December, 1803, at the ripe age of
ninety years, having witnessed the inauguration of three
Presidents, all of whom were his warm and personal
friends, his life-work closed.</p>

<h3>II<br />

DUTCH NOMENCLATURE</h3>

<p>In a letter written from Holland to the Brooklyn
"Eagle," Henry C. Murphy gave an interesting explanation
of the chief characteristics of Dutch nomenclature.
In the course of this letter Mr. Murphy <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"In order to show what difficulties the peculiar system
adopted in this country (Holland), and continued by the
settlers in our own home, throw in the way of tracing
genealogies, it is to be observed that the first of these, in
point of time, was the patronymic, as it is called, by which
a child took, besides his own baptismal name, that of his
father, with the addition of <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">zoon</i>, or <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">sen</i>, meaning son. To
illustrate this: if a child were baptized Hendrick, and
the baptismal name of his father were Jan, the child
would be called Hendrick Jansen. His son, if baptized
Tunis, would be called Tunis Hendricksen; and the son
of the latter might be Willem, and would have the name
Willem Tunisen. And so we might have the succeeding
generations called successively Garret Willemsen, Marten
Garretsen, Adrien Martensen, and so on, through the
whole of the calendar of Christian names; or, as more
frequently happened, there would be repetition, in the second,
third, or fourth generation, of the name of the first;
and thus, as these names were common to the whole people,
there were in every community different lineages of
identically the same name. This custom, which had prevailed
in Holland for centuries, was in full vogue at the
time of the settlement of New Netherland. In writing
the termination <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">sen</i>, it was frequently contracted into <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">se</i>,
or <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">z</i>, or <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">s</i>. Thus the name of William Barretsen, who
commanded in the first three Arctic voyages of exploration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
in 1594, 1595, and 1596, is given in the old accounts
of those voyages, Barretsen, Barentse, Barentz, Barents;
sometimes in one way, sometimes in another, indifferently.
Or, to give an example nearer home, both of the
patronymic custom and of the contraction of the name, the
father of Garret Martense, the founder of a family of that
name in Flatbush, was Martin Adriense, and his father
was Adriæ Ryerse, who came from Amsterdam. The inconveniences
of this practice, the confusion to which it
gave rise, and the difficulty of tracing families, led ultimately
to its abandonment, both in Holland and in our
own country. In doing so, the patronymic, which the
person originating the name bore, was adopted as the
surname. Most of the family names thus formed and
originating amongst us may be said to be of American
origin, as they were first fixed in America, though the
same names were adopted by others in Holland. Hence
we have the names of such families of Dutch descent
amongst us as Jansen (<em>anglice</em>, Johnson), Garretsen, Cornelisen,
Williamsen or Williamson, Hendricksen or Hendrickson,
Clasen, Simonsen or Simonson, Tysen (son of
Mathias), Arendsen (son of Arend), Hansen, Lambertsen
or Lambertson, Paulisen, <span class="locked">Remsen,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a></span><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> Ryersen, Martense,
Adrience, Rutgers, Everts, Phillips, Lefferts, and others.
To trace connection between these families and persons
in this country, it is evident, would be impossible, for the
reason stated, without a regular record.</p>

<p>"Another mode of nomenclature, intended to obviate
the difficulty of an identity of names for the time being,
but which rendered the confusion worse confounded for
the future genealogist, was to add to the patronymic
name the occupation or some other personal characteristic
of the individual. Thus, Laurens Jansen, the inventor
of the art of printing, as the Dutch claim, had affixed
to his name that of Coster&mdash;that is to say, <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">sexton</i>&mdash;an
office of which he was in the possession of the emoluments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
But the same addition was not transmitted to
his son; and thus the son of Hendrick Jansen Coster
might be called Tunis Hendrickson Brouwer (brewer),
and his grandson might be William Tunissen Bleecker
(bleacher)....</p>

<p>"A third practice, evidently designed, like that referred
to, to obviate the confusions of the first, was to append
the name of the place where the person resided, not
often of a large city, but of a particular, limited locality,
and frequently of a particular form or natural object.
This custom is denoted in all the family names which
have the prefix of <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Van</i>, <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Vander</i>, <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Ver</i> (which is a contraction
of <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Vander</i>), and <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Ten</i>, meaning, respectively, <em>of</em>, <em>of
the</em> and <em>at the</em>.... The prefixes <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Vander</i> or <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Ver</i> and <i xml:lang="nl" lang="nl">Ten</i>
were adopted where the name was derived from a particular
spot, thus: Vanderveer (of the ferry); Vanderburg,
of the hill; Vanderbilt (of the bildt, that is, certain
elevations of ground in Guederhoff and New Utrecht);
Vanderbeck (of the brook); Vanderhoff (of the court);
Verplanck (of the plank); Verhultz (of the holly); Verkerk
(of the church); Ten Eyck (at the oak); Tenbroeck
(at the marsh)."</p>

<h3>III<br />

NEW YORK AND BROOKLYN FERRY RIGHTS</h3>

<p>New York City's exclusive claims to the ferry rights
are almost as old as Brooklyn itself. Brooklyn was settled
in 1636, and in less than twenty years, and while
there was but a handful of people on this side of the
river, the ferry from Peck Slip to Nassau Island, at a
point corresponding to the present foot of Fulton Street,
had become a public question. In the natural course of
things, New York had first started the ferry. When the
English conquered New Netherland, and Peter Stuyvesant
stepped down (with his wooden leg) from the governorship
of New Amsterdam, the conquered province
was patented by Charles II. of England to the Duke of
York, who afterwards became James II., and in whose
honor New Amsterdam was re-named New York. The
Dutch Governor was succeeded by an English Governor,
the Duke's representative, Nicolls; and Dutch traditions
and codes were succeeded by the famous "Duke's Laws."
The new Governor granted to the little hamlet of Brooklyn
a patent confirmatory of that received from the Dutch
Governor, a measure that was in conformity with the
general policy of the conquerors.</p>

<p>This patent, after naming the patentees, and describing
the bounds of the town, and bounding by the river,
and not by high or low water mark, proceeded to say:
"Together with all havens, harbors, creeks, marshes,
waters, rivers, lakes, and fisheries." The charter adds:
"Moreover, I do hereby give, ratify, and confirm unto the
said patentees and their associates, and their heirs, successors,
and assigns, all the rights and privileges belonging
to a town within their government." Under this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
patent the town of Brooklyn first claimed the ownership
of land between high and low water mark on the Brooklyn
side, and an equal right with New York to erect and
maintain ferries.</p>

<p>We find no adverse claim on the part of New York
until nineteen years afterward, in 1686, when the Corporation
of New York obtained from Governor Dongan a
charter by which the ferries were granted to New York.
But this charter says nothing about water rights, and
expressly reserves the rights of all other persons and
bodies corporate or politic. Moreover, Brooklyn in the
same year secured from Dongan a patent fully confirming
that of Nicolls. A similar confirmation was secured
in 1691. But New York was still running the ferry, and
to fortify its claims bought land on the Brooklyn side in
1694.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">
  <a href="images/i262l.jpg">
  <img id="if_i262" src="images/i262.jpg" width="589" height="291" alt="" class="lborder" /></a><br />
  <div class="caption">CHART SHOWING EAST RIVER SOUNDINGS AND PIER LINES
</div></div>

<p>In the reign of Queen Anne the Corporation of New
York induced that infamous trickster and reprobate,
Governor Cornbury, to give New York a charter, by
which it was to be entitled to all "vacant and unappropriated
land" below high water mark from the Wallabout
to Red Hook. The charter was really void, for there
was no unappropriated land in the region named, previous
patents and charters having given them to Brooklyn
as a town. In 1721 the colonial legislature confirmed
Brooklyn's rights, but New York's politicians bought for
a specific sum ($5000) a new charter from Governor
Montgomerie confirming the pretended right of New
York to ownership in land to high-water mark on the
Brooklyn shore. New York secured a charter ownership
in 400 feet of land under water around the whole lower
part of the city, and step by step, with money and unfaltering
political trickery, the city set itself against the
development and independence of Brooklyn. By Section
37 of the Montgomerie charter, the ferry franchise was
confirmed "forever," with a provision that no other person
or persons whomsoever should have the right to
establish a ferry or ferries in the premises. Legislative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
acts and legal decisions have been piled up around a
pretense, the fallacy and injustice of which appear upon
examination of the early records.</p>

<p>New York was not satisfied with the crafty legislation
by which it sought to overawe the village across the
river. It began to question the right of Brooklyn people
to cross to New York in their own boats. The result
was that a Brooklyn man, Hendrick Remsen, sued the
New York Corporation. He won his case; the Corporation
appealed to the King, and the matter remained undecided
in consequence of the Revolution. Although
the Constitution of the State confirms all grants of land
within the State made by authority of the King of Great
Britain or his predecessors, prior to August 14, 1775,
New York afterward adhered to its false claims to the
river rights. However, by State rulings within the present
century, Brooklyn was permitted to exercise jurisdiction
to low-water mark. A Supreme Court decision in
1821 declares that the City and County of New York
includes the whole of the rivers and harbor adjoining to
actual low-water mark on the opposite shores. It was
only in 1824 that Brooklyn was able to secure from the
Legislature concurrent jurisdiction with New York in the
service of process, in actions civil and criminal, on board
of vessels attached to its own wharves.</p>

<p>When Brooklyn sought to erect itself into a city, New
York met the proposition with the same spirit of unwillingness
to recognize in the sister town any right to
individual existence. Every step that Brooklyn took
toward securing municipal rights was hampered by the
opposition of New York politicians. Brooklyn became a
city in 1834, in spite of New York's opposition. New
York retired from the fight with its fraudulent ownership
of the river and the "ferry rights," by which it was and
still is able to levy a continuous tax upon Brooklyn.</p>

1819. During the time of his residence in Brooklyn he did
editorial writing for both the <cite>Times</cite> and the <cite>Eagle</cite>. In the
following letter to Mr. Charles M. Skinner, of Brooklyn, he
describes his newspaper work in this city:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">328 Mickle Street, Camden, New Jersey</span>,
</p>
<p class="sigright">
<em>January 19, '85</em>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In hasty answer to your request asking me to
specify over my own signature what year I worked as an editorial
writer in the Brooklyn <cite>Times</cite> office, I would say that if
I remember right it was along in 1856, or just before. I recollect
(doubtless I am now going to be egotistical about it) the
question of the new Water Works (magnificently outlined by
McAlpine, and duly carried out and improved by Kirkwood,
first-class engineers both) was still pending, and the works,
though well under way, continued to be strongly opposed by
many. With the consent of the proprietor, I bent the whole
weight of the paper steadily in favor of the McAlpine plan, as
against a flimsy, cheap, and temporary series of works that
would have long since broken down, and disgraced the city.
</p>
<p>
This, with my course on another matter,&mdash;the securing to
public use of Washington Park (old Fort Greene), stoutly championed
by me some thirty-five years ago, against heavy odds,
during an editorship of the Brooklyn <cite>Eagle</cite>,&mdash;are "feathers in
my wings" that I would wish to preserve.
</p>
<p>
I heard lately with genuine sorrow of the death of George
C. Bennett. I remember him well as a good, generous, honorable
man.
</p>
<p>
I send best greetings to your staff, and, indeed, to all the
Brooklyn journalists.

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a> In connection with the cupola of the City Hall, a very
interesting incident occurred in 1852. It was noticed that this
feature of the building swayed, and needed to be strengthened.
The necessary steps were taken to render it firm and secure.
At the time the men were engaged in the work the court of
oyer and terminer was holding a session in the room known
and distinguished as the Governor's room, Judge N.&nbsp;B. Morse
presiding. One day while the court was engaged in a criminal
trial, a beam which was being raised slipped from the rope,
and fell upon the roof above the court-room, causing the plaster
and ceiling to give way. At once the court officers, jurors,
and spectators became alarmed; some ran for the door, some
for the windows, and others sought refuge under the tables.
Judge Morse took a position by one of the windows, and,
shaking his fist at the audience, exclaimed, "The wicked flee
when no man pursueth." A few of the frightened ones got on
their knees and fervently prayed. The prisoner at the bar
was the only one unmoved.&mdash;S.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;O.</p></div>

post forty years later, on March 8, 1887. His relations to the
city of Brooklyn were exceptional, and in many respects marvelous.
No other single personality in this city ever won a
prominence so significant, so salutary, so momentous. One of
Brooklyn's most brilliant thinkers, writers, and speakers, the
Rev. John W. Chadwick, D.D., has spoken of Mr. Beecher
as 'the most unique and splendid personality of our civic history;
one of the most unique and splendid in the history of the
United States and their colonial beginnings.' The homage to
Beecher's genius as a teacher and leader of men has come
from thinking men wherever the English language is spoken.
The homage which belongs to him as a citizen, as a pastor, as
a humanitarian, as a patriot, has been enthusiastically offered
by his fellow-countrymen, and particularly by his neighbors in
the city of Brooklyn. The bronze monument to Mr. Beecher,
designed by John Q.&nbsp;A. Ward, was placed in front of the City
Hall in 1891.</p></div>

insures unity of administration, it encourages promptness and
economy, it locates and defines responsibility, and it is so simple
that everybody can understand it. The people, having but
few officers to elect, are more likely to know something about
them. Especially since everybody understands that the success
of the government depends upon the character of the
Mayor, extraordinary pains are taken to secure good mayors;
and the increased interest in city politics is shown by the fact
that in Brooklyn more people vote for Mayor than for Governor
or for President."</p></div>
